// Section lifetime (rendering workstream J). A decoded section is handed out as a
// SectionRef -- shared ownership of an immutable image. Holding the ref PINS the
// image: the cache never evicts an entry while anyone else holds it (the cache's
// own reference is then not the only one), and an image the cache dropped (budget
// eviction, clear()) stays alive until its last holder lets go. So a consumer keeps
// its inputs exactly as long as it uses them -- the chunk worker for one compose
// job, the render thread for one texture upload -- and everything else is
// evictable. Before J the API returned a reference "valid until clear()", which
// made clear() require every consumer to stop first and made any eviction unsafe.
