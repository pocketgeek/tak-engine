// Random map generator. Produces a tak::tnt::Map (+ start positions) procedurally
// from a small parameter set, deterministically (integer-only) so a multiplayer
// client and the server referee build the BYTE-IDENTICAL map from the same seed --
// the generated terrain/features feed the hashed lockstep sim, so it must agree on
// every peer. The parameters ride inside the mapId string ("~gen1~<hex>"), which the
// lobby threads to every peer. A recipe is version 10, with the retail cliff/plateau,
// mountain and town kits; an id carrying any other version is malformed.
