// Colour-atlas painting for model textures and per-atlas tracking of the frame
// each animated region holds (render optimization workstream B; see
// docs/render-optimization-progress.md).
//
// Every model texture has one rect in each player-colour atlas, with a one-texel
// clamped gutter inside a two-texel pad (GameView::buildAtlasLayout). Animated
// sequences select one frame for ALL colour atlases from the game tick; a region's
// content is therefore a pure function of that frame value:
//   * frame < frames.size(): the frame texture copied with blend NONE, plus a
//     gutter of its own edge texels;
//   * otherwise (a non-looping sequence that has expired): transparent, gutter
//     included.
// So a region is current exactly when it was last painted with the same frame
// value, under the same renderer and asset generations. AnimatedAtlasTracker keeps
// that record per atlas and repaints only regions whose frame changed, instead of
// repainting every animated region of every atlas whenever any sequence advanced.
//
// Presentation state only: nothing here feeds the simulation.

// SDL records a copy's blend mode in its command queue when the copy is queued,
// but reads the texture's SCALE mode when the queue RUNS (GL texture parameters;
// the software renderer's scaler). The gutter strips must sample NEAREST, so a
// source that is not already NEAREST is switched once -- after a flush, so draws of
// it queued earlier still run with its own mode -- and switched back in finish(),
// after one flush that runs everything queued meanwhile. Model textures are created
// NEAREST and never change, so in practice no flush is needed at all; the protection
// stays for any source that is not. (The previous per-region code flushed every
// region; its body copy also ran NEAREST on GL, since the mode is applied to the GL
// texture immediately and the queued copy ran after it.)
