// Voice chat, client side: the microphone, Opus, one jitter buffer per talker and the
// voice output device (docs/multiplayer-design.md, "Voice chat").
//
// PRESENTATION / IO ONLY. Nothing here reaches the simulation, World::stateHash, the
// lockstep command stream or a replay; the frames travel on their own message types
// (net::Msg::VoiceUp / VoiceDown), relayed by the server. It owns no MpClient either:
// outbound frames leave through the Sender the host passes to update(), inbound ones
// arrive through push(). Every method runs on the main thread, and the audio devices
// use SDL's queue API (no audio callback), so there is nothing to lock.
//
// Devices open only while needed: the microphone while in a voice room or while the
// VOICE CHAT screen shows its level meter (and it records only while talking or
// metering), the output while in a voice room. With voice chat off nothing opens at all,
// and the headless harnesses never construct an engine.
