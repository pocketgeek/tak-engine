// Triangle depth-sort weights INSIDE one model. We draw through
// SDL_RenderGeometry with no depth buffer, so overlapping pieces of a model need
// an order.
//
// DERIVED FROM THE PROJECTION, not from a camera angle. collect() emits
// position.y = -(kProjY*y + kProjZ*z) = -(0.5y + z), so two points land on the
// same pixel when 0.5*dy + dz = 0, i.e. along (dy,dz) = (2,-1). THAT is the view
// ray, and toward the camera is +y, -z: up is nearer, and model +z reads
// up-screen, which is away.
//
// So depth from the camera goes as (z - 2y), and the sort runs descending,
// farthest first.
//
// Getting here took two wrong turns worth remembering. The weights started as
// cos/sin of a 0.72 rad "tilt" the projection does not have (ratio 1.14 instead
// of 2). Then I "fixed" the SIGN as well, reasoning from retail's own
// screenY = z - y/2 -- but our code negates ry, so our z runs the other way, and
// flipping it put every z-separated pair in backwards order. The original signs
// were right; only the magnitudes were wrong.
//
// Retail does not sort at all: it z-buffers (Glide grDepthBuffer*, and the
// DirectDraw path's "no hardware support for zbuffer blting" complaint; the
// piece walk at icd 0x4eea20 has no depth compare in it). So this remains an
// approximation of a depth buffer -- correct ordering between triangles, still
// unable to resolve two that interpenetrate.

inline constexpr float kSortZ = 1.0f;   // weight on model Z (opposite sign to Y)

// Retail's 2.5D projection, straight off the instruction sequence at icd
// 0x421dad:
//     screenX = x - cameraX
//     screenY = z - (y >> 1) - cameraY
// so screen Y takes ALL of z and HALF of y, and screen X takes no y at all.
// Note this is not a rotation -- the coefficients are 1.0 and 0.5, which are not
// the cosine and sine of any angle -- so it cannot be expressed as a tilt. We
// modelled it as one for a long time (cos/sin of gTilt = 0.75/0.66) and were
// wrong in both terms. The same halving governs the terrain lift: 0x511140
// returns a cell's height byte and 0x426820 subtracts height>>1.
