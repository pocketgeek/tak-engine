// Push-to-talk (and, below, voice activation) as a pure state machine (no SDL), so the rules are tested directly.
// The host feeds it the presses and releases of the push-to-talk chord, and every frame
// whether talking is allowed at all, whether a text field has keyboard focus, whether
// the window has it, and whether the key is still physically down.
//
//  - A press starts talking only when talking is allowed and nothing is being typed:
//    a Space typed into the chat box, a lobby field or a name entry is text, not voice,
//    and the press is NOT consumed so the field gets it.
//  - A held key never leaks: the moment a text field takes focus, the window loses
//    focus, talking stops being allowed (left the room, voice switched off, the CONTROLS
//    screen is capturing a key) or the key is found up without our having seen the
//    release, the transmission ends. It restarts only on a fresh press.
