// Rebindable in-game hotkeys. A small fixed set of command/selection/emote actions,
// each with a default key chord, overridable per user and edited in the Hotkeys
// screen (src/client/hotkeysscreen). The number-row control groups (Ctrl/Alt+digit),
// game-speed +/- and a few dev keys are structural and intentionally NOT rebindable.
//
// Bindings persist by ACTION ID (stable strings), so reordering the table or adding
// actions never disturbs a saved config; only entries that differ from the default
// are written (so a later default change propagates to anyone who didn't rebind).
