// Shared renderer vocabulary for the rendering optimization program
// (docs/render-optimization-progress.md): per-frame telemetry, generation and
// revision numbers, and stable render handles. Everything here is PRESENTATION
// state. None of it may become an input to the deterministic simulation, enter
// World::stateHash(), or change what a frame draws.
//
// Telemetry contract
//   * FrameStats is owned by the render thread. Workers never write it: they
//     leave per-item results (UnitGeom::reused, vertex counts, ...) that the
//     render thread tallies after the parallel pass. No atomics, no locks.
//   * Recording is off unless a debug harness asks for it (TAK_RENDER_STATS,
//     or the render study; TAK_RENDER_STATS=0 turns it off inside the study to
//     measure the telemetry's own cost). A release build (NDEBUG) compiles
//     kTelemetryCompiled to false, so every tally, ScopedPhase and submit counter
//     folds away; a debug build pays one not-taken branch while off.
//   * Never allocate or format strings in a hot loop. format() runs once per
//     frame into a caller-owned buffer.
//   * Phase times ("t_") are CPU WALL time on the render thread, including any
//     worker wait inside that phase. Some phases NEST inside others (marked
//     below); never add the t_ values up. Worker times ("w_") are CPU time
//     SUMMED over every thread that ran the work -- not wall time, and not
//     comparable to t_ values. GPU time is reported by the render study as the
//     GL draw TIMELINE (GL_TIME_ELAPSED) -- it includes idle gaps waiting for CPU
//     submission and is NOT device busy time or utilization. Nothing here
//     measures GPU busy time (no portable per-process counter exists).
//
// Generation / revision vocabulary (use these words, not new ones)
//   * Generation: a monotonically increasing 64-bit number naming a LIFETIME.
//     0 (kNoGeneration) means "never valid". Anything that caches a resource
//     created under a generation stores that generation and treats a mismatch
//     as a miss. Generations defined for the renderer:
//       rendererGeneration -- SDL renderer / render-target lifetime. Bumped by
//                             GameView::invalidateRenderTargets (target or
//                             device reset) and GPU teardown. Every cached
//                             SDL_Texture*, GL buffer or atlas placement is
//                             only meaningful under the generation it was made.
//       assetGeneration    -- model / texture / palette registration lifetime
//                             (mod remount, model reload).
//       snapshotGeneration -- the published sim snapshot the render pinned.
//   * Revision: a per-entry counter that increments when that entry's OUTPUT
//     changes. Stages each own one: pose, material (body appearance), shadow
//     coverage, placement (screen position / clipping). A revision is a cheap
//     equality token for downstream caches; it is never derived from the
//     simulation tick alone (presentation inputs change between ticks), and it
//     never replaces exact validation while a scheme is being proven.
//   * RenderHandle: {index, generation} into a bounded slot table. A handle is
//     a stable identity for a cache entry that survives painter-order changes.
//     A reused index always carries a new generation, so a stale handle (a
//     destroyed unit, a reused unit id, a replaced model) can never alias the
//     new occupant.
