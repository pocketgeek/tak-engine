// Save the replay the CLIENT recorded (MpClient::replayLog) as a .takrep, in the
// same format and the same byte layout the server's --replaydir writes: the header
// fields below are mirrored from Server::writeReplay, and the bundles are the raw
// payloads the server broadcast, so the two writers cannot drift.
//
// Every human player records its own copy, which is what makes a replay survive a
// server that keeps none -- and a client only ever has the game it was in, so there
// is nothing here that a player could not already see.
//
// `dir` is the user's config directory (settingsPath()'s folder), so replays live
// beside settings.ini rather than in whatever the working directory happened to be.
// Returns the written path, or empty on failure.
// `gameplayHash` is the fingerprint of the data the GAME ran on (the client's
// gameDataHash(), what it reports at Loaded) -- NOT the pure-retail handshake hash,
// which differs under a Full-tier override.
