// the raw payloads the server broadcast. net/replaywriter.h streams header and
// bundles to disk as the game is played (GameView::beginGameRecording).
//
// Every human player and spectator records its own copy, which is what makes a
// replay survive a server that keeps none -- and a client only ever has the game it
// was in, so there is nothing here that a player could not already see.
//
// `gameplayHash` is the fingerprint of the data the GAME ran on (the client's
// gameDataHash(), what it reports at Loaded) -- NOT the pure-retail handshake hash,
// which differs under a Full-tier override.
