// artscale -- edge-directed 2x upscale for the retail sprite art.
//
// The shipped art is 1999-era and authored for a 640x480 screen: cursors are 20-30px,
// GUI panels and faction backdrops not much better. On a 4K panel, magnified by the UI
// scale, every one of those pixels is a visible block.
//
// STATIC ART ONLY -- GUI, panels, buttons, faction/menu backdrops, weapon pics,
// cursors. Deliberately NOT the unit and feature frames: those go through the shared
// atlas and there are hundreds of them, so 4x the pixels would be real VRAM on a card
// this engine has already been caught starving, for art that is usually on screen at a
// fraction of its authored size anyway. SDL's linear filter (the
// existing `bilinear` option) smooths them at DRAW time, but it is interpolating 1x
// data, so it can only blur -- a hard diagonal becomes a soft diagonal of the same
// staircase. An edge-directed scaler does better because it INFERS the edge from the
// neighbourhood: where two neighbours agree with each other and disagree with the
// centre, that is a corner, and the output subpixel there gets blended instead of
// copied. Diagonals come out smooth rather than blurred.
//
// This runs ONCE per texture, at load. Nothing here is on a frame path.
//
// The rule is the classic Eagle/hq2x corner test, kept deliberately small:
//
//       A B C          each output 2x2 subpixel looks at the two neighbours
//       D E F          adjacent to its corner -- top-left looks at D and B --
//       G H I          and blends when they match each other but not E.
//
// Working in premultiplied alpha matters: the art is full of fully transparent
// pixels whose RGB is arbitrary (often black or the palette's key colour), and
// blending those straight would drag dark fringes into every silhouette edge.
