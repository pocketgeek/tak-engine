// Reuse of retained shadow silhouette tiles (workstream E).
//
// Every unit's shadow is rasterized into its own tile of a silhouette page
// (GameView::buildShadowSilhouetteAtlas). A tile's pixels are a function of
// exactly these raster inputs:
//
//   * the tile rectangle: page, slot, width, height (cleared with padding);
//   * the tile-relative points, one per placed shadow vertex:
//       tilePoint(placed) = placed * scale - pixel + slot + 1
//     where placed = placeShadowPoint(local, placement) (client/geometrystages.h);
//   * the cutout faces' coverage textures, UVs and colours, in run order.
//
// Before E a tile was redrawn whenever the unit's geometry `revision` moved —
// any stage, including body-only colour and material changes — or its screen
// pixel position changed. E keys the tile on what it actually depends on:
//
//   coverage   UnitGeom::shadowRevision: the exact local silhouette (local
//              points, cutout UVs/colours/runs). Advanced only when that output
//              differs, never by a body-only change.
//   placement  the exact ShadowPlacement (zoom, anchor + altitude lean) the
//              points were placed with, compared bit for bit.
//
// Same coverage and same placement => the same points => the same tile.
// A changed placement is not assumed to move the tile content: the tile is kept
// only when every tile-relative point recomputes BIT-IDENTICAL under the old and
// the new placement (sameTilePoints). That holds for whole-pixel translations
// that keep each coordinate in its floating-point binade; a fractional shift
// changes the sub-pixel phase, the points differ and the tile is redrawn. No
// translation is ever assumed to be exact.
//
// Everything here is presentation state; nothing reaches the simulation.
