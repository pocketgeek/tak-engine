// The retail loading screen (`guis/loadscreen.gui`): the LoadingBG plate, the map name,
// a status line, a percentage, one overall progress bar, and a per-player name + bar
// column down the left so you can see who the game is still waiting on.
//
// Used as a scoped object around the heavy part of starting a game: construct it, call
// step() as each phase finishes, and let it fall out of scope when the first tick runs.
// Each step() draws and presents a frame itself, because the work it brackets blocks
// the render loop.
