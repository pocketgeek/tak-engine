// REMEMBER KEY for the YouTube streaming panel (client/streaming.cpp): an opt-in copy of
// the stream key in the OS credential store (client/credstore.h), loaded masked into the
// key field at the next launch. Only the on/off preference is a setting
// (Settings::streamRememberKey); the key never goes into settings or any other file.
//
// While the box is ticked the stored key follows the key field. It is written when the
// box is ticked, when a key is pasted, when streaming starts, and when the panel closes
// (closing the application with it open counts). A field that is empty at any of those
// moments -- Ctrl+A clears it at once -- deletes the stored key instead of leaving a
// stale one. Unticking deletes it. Typed characters are not written one by one.
//
// Every store call runs on one worker thread, in order, so a slow Secret Service or an
// unlock prompt never stalls the render loop. The panel calls poll() each frame to pick
// up results. Destruction waits briefly for queued writes and deletes, so an untick just
// before quitting still takes effect, then abandons a call stuck on a prompt.
