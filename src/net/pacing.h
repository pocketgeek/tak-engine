// Client jitter-buffer pacing math: the bundle-arrival jitter estimate (MpClient) and the
// buffer-depth target the playout servo holds (GameView::mpStep). Pure functions of their
// inputs, no clock and no I/O, so tools/pacing_test.cpp can drive them with scripted times.
// Pacing only: which bundles play, and in what order, never changes, so no sim state or hash
// depends on anything here.
//
// 0.9.1 fix D ("+10 stuck at +4"): two controllers fought. The arrival time was stamped when
// the client POLLED, so the client's own stall (alt-tab, a menu, the load gap of a watch game)
// read as a second or more of network jitter; the target then asked for more buffered ticks
// than the server's flow control lets a client hold (flowLeadTicks), the buffer could never
// reach it, and the playout sat at its 0.7 floor -- 0.7 x 2.0 = 1.40x for a minute or more.
// Retail has no jitter buffer at all: its speed setter (0x4999b0) writes the requested and the
// effective level together and it throttles only on frame time and MP lag (0x526090).
