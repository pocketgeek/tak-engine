// Account login for multiplayer: binary SCRAM-SHA-256.
//
// WHY SCRAM. The requirements are that the password never travels in the clear
// and the server never stores it. A naive "hash the password and send the hash"
// meets neither in practice: the hash IS the password on the wire (replay it and
// you are in), and the stored copy is then a password-equivalent secret, so one
// leaked config file logs an attacker into every account.
//
// SCRAM (RFC 5802, SHA-256 variant RFC 7677) is the standard answer and gives us:
//
//   * The password is never transmitted, in any form. What crosses the wire is a
//     proof computed over a fresh server nonce, so capturing it replays nowhere.
//   * The server stores StoredKey = SHA256(ClientKey) and ServerKey. Proving you
//     know the password requires ClientKey, and recovering ClientKey from
//     StoredKey is a SHA-256 preimage. So stealing the accounts file does NOT
//     let the thief log in -- it only lets them run an offline guessing attack,
//     which the PBKDF2 work factor below is there to make expensive.
//   * Mutual authentication: the server returns a signature only someone holding
//     ServerKey can produce, so a machine that impersonates the server cannot
//     convince the client it knows the account.
//
// We speak it over our own binary framing rather than SASL's base64 text, since
// the protocol is already binary and the encoding carries no security.
//
// WHAT THIS IS NOT. There is no transport encryption. SCRAM protects the
// password and the login; it does not hide the rest of the session, and a
// man-in-the-middle present at FIRST REGISTRATION of an account can substitute
// their own credential, because there is nothing yet to bind that account to.
// Once an account exists, a MITM can no longer authenticate as it.
//
// Unknown usernames are reported as unknown, by design -- the client has to be
// told in order to offer to create the account. That does let someone probe
// which usernames exist; it is the explicit cost of self-service registration.
