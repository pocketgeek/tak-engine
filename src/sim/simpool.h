// SimPool: a persistent fork-join worker pool for the deterministic simulation.
//
// Work is split into FIXED-size chunks of a range (kUnitChunk units by default),
// never into "count / threads" slices, so the chunk boundaries -- and therefore
// any per-chunk result -- do not depend on how many threads run them. The
// calling thread takes part; workers claim chunks from an atomic counter.
//
// Exactness rules for a caller (see WE-parallel P0):
//   - a chunk writes only its own slots (per-unit records, or arenas indexed by
//     the chunk number), or performs an order-independent update (an atomic OR);
//   - any merge of per-chunk results runs after forChunks returns, in chunk order.
// With 0 workers (World::setSerialThreads, or too small a range) the identical
// chunks run inline in ascending order, so serial == workers by construction.
//
// Workers spin briefly for the next job, then sleep on a condition variable, so
// an idle pool costs nothing between ticks and a fork-join costs no thread spawn.
// The caller never waits for a worker that is asleep or descheduled: it waits
// only for the chunks to finish and for workers already inside the job to
// leave, so a busy machine (two sims in single player) degrades to the caller
// doing the work itself rather than to a stall.
