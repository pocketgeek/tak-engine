    // picks the jobs of the class's window in key order and the chain regions each will attach next, while their
    // predicted attach work fits a job's two slices and the quota left (a deterministic choice from the sim state,
    // before any job runs), computes each region's key as attachNode does (tileKey) and, for a key that neither the
    // cache nor the staging holds, starts a job with IMMUTABLE inputs of its own: the key, the seed cells and a copy
    // of the legality and labels it reads (TileJob). The jobs run asynchronously while the serial pass goes on; nothing
    // is published by a worker. The serial pass runs exactly as before and consumes by exact identity:

    //    cannot differ -- the same route (serial), node (region, generations, portal) and soft grid (softSerial, bumped by
    //    every stamp change) -- and charges the same work the scan would;
    //  * where tileFor misses its cache it takes the staged tile whose whole key is equal (takePrefetched), waiting for
    //    its job if a worker is still on it (helping with jobs nobody has started meanwhile), and charges the work its
    //    build counted.
    // The cache, the budgets, the eviction order and every decision see the same keys and tiles, in the same order,
    // with the same work, prepared or not, on any number of workers and in any completion order: a slower machine waits
    // at the consumer (and at the pass's end, where every job is joined before the pool serves anything else); it never
    // publishes a different subset. A staged tile nobody took stays staged for kStagedTicks passes, then is dropped --
    // never inserted, never counted in NavBytes; a prepared key is good for its pass only. A speculation that missed (an
    // aimed region whose seeds turned out unreachable, a node re-resolved on new geometry) costs only the wasted job.

    // One deterministic quota a tick (NavBudget::kFieldQuota, less the plane debt, at most half of
    // it) pays field relaxations, field initialisation (cells / kInitDiv at a start) and reach-ring
    // cells. The work is served by JOB: a field being built, however many groups share it, so a
    // shared field gets one allocation. A job's class is the most urgent its groups ask for:
    // Waiting (a member stands still for want of it, or a paused build it waits on), FirstRoute (a
    // group's first field), AwareRepair (an awareness re-plan), StaleRefresh (after a static change;
    // the members steer by the finished stale field). Classes are served in that order; within a
    // class the jobs share the quota by deficit round robin (navDrr: a slice of kSlice a visit, the
    // cursor kept across ticks, so no job is always last), the two refresh classes inside the
    // refresh allowance (kRefreshQuota) as before. A job (or a start request) that has gone
    // kAgeStep ticks without service moves up one class (navPromote; a promoted refresh no longer
    // spends the refresh allowance), so no class starves another for longer than three steps.
    // Start requests -- groups with no field, then stale refreshes -- are admitted at the head of
    // their class, oldest request first; one refused for want of room (the byte allowance or the
    // field count) is stepped over, at most kFitScan a tick, unless it has been refused for
    // kReserveAge ticks: then it reserves and nothing after it starts this tick (NavAdmit), so the
    // room that frees next is its. A start whose initialisation does not fit the budget left waits
    // for the next tick (the first start of a tick always fits). Once the room scan has stopped (the
    // bound or a reservation) the requests behind it are still tried, but only for a share of a field
    // that already exists: a share takes no room (Start::Shared allocates nothing), so blocking it
    // would give the reserved request nothing back. Everything here reads hashed state
    // only and walks ids, serials and lists in a fixed order.
    // A job holds its field (keep) for the whole serveFields call, so a field an install or an eviction
