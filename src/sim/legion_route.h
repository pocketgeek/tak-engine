// legion_route.h -- the route-query interface of Legion's navigator (Legion 10,000 stage 5, brief phase 4;
// docs/legion-10000-progress.md 3.3, docs/legion-pathfinding.md "Legion 10,000 stage 5").
//
// Movement consumers -- steering and its descent, the pinwheel and the passage gate, group awareness, destination
// packing (formation and packed slots, the area bounds), attack rings, the settle rule, the lift walk -- read a route
// through RouteView only. RouteGrid is the storage behind it: one integer window per route, owned and written by the
// route builder (legion.cpp: startField, advance, serve), stored in sparse tiles since stage 6 (legion_hier.h's
// sectors); nothing outside the builder and this header reads RouteGrid's cells.
//
// What a query can answer is kept apart:
//  * an estimate (direction guidance): exact where settled; on a build still running, where the frontier reached a
//    cell but has not settled it, the length of a real (not necessarily shortest) way; kNone where nothing is known.
//    A descent on estimates strictly decreases and ends at a seed, so it steers soundly on a half-built route;
//  * a known distance: exact, or kNone -- never a tentative value;
//  * reachability: Reachable (some finite estimate: a real way exists), Unreachable (proven: a complete route that
//    spans the cell's whole static component, and that no static change has reached since its build began, does not
//    reach it), Unknown (anything else: not computed yet, outside a bounded window, or touched by a later change --
//    whose group is then stale and refreshing). Unknown never retires an order;
//  * coverage: a cell settled with a margin of key to spare, i.e. every cell whose key is within the margin of it
//    is final (A* with a consistent heuristic settles keys in order). A consumer states the region it needs as
//    (cell, margin); see RouteView::covered;
//  * progress: a distance together with the metric it is measured in (the route's serial). Progress compares only
//    within one metric; a new metric re-baselines and never counts as a gain;
//  * freshness: the geometry epoch the route was built on, and whether a later change touched it, apart from all of
//    the above.
