// Retail's pathfinder, ported from KINGDOMS.icd by static analysis.
//
// It is NOT an A*. There is no open list, no priority queue and no cost-to-goal
// ordering anywhere in the original. It marches straight at the goal and, when
// something blocks it, traces the obstacle's outline from BOTH sides at once
// until one of them regains the origin-to-goal line -- a "bug" algorithm. See
// docs/retail-engine.md for the full disassembly notes; addresses in the
// comments below are the icd entry points the code mirrors.
//
// Everything here is integer arithmetic on 16px cells, and the per-frame work
// budget is an integer too (retail's default is 12000 units), so a match runs
// identically on every peer. No timers, no floats: safe for lockstep.
//
// Three phases, mirroring the original's state machine at +0x60:
//   1  OCTANT march from the true start, counting the quality of what it
//      crosses and giving up on the third occupied cell (icd 0x414833).
//   2  CARDINAL march from the current origin, laying a breadcrumb in every
//      cell it enters, until something blocks it (0x414a6a).
//   3  TWIN boundary traces, counter-rotating, running at the same time; the
//      first one to regain the straight line from the origin to the goal
//      becomes the new origin and hands back to phase 2 (0x414c25, with the
//      M-line test at 0x414dc4 and the hand-offs at 0x414fde / 0x414ff8).
// Reaching a cell flagged as the goal ends the search, and the route is
// reconstructed by walking the breadcrumbs back (0x414450).
//
// This IS the sim's pathfinder. PathService below owns the queue, the bounded pool of
// concurrent searches and the per-tick budget; World::requestPath feeds it and installs
// finished routes as order legs (replaceLeg). The header used to end "NOT WIRED INTO
// THE SIM YET", which was true only until it was.

// The request queue and its per-tick budget scheduler (icd 0x416430).
//
// Retail counts every pending request across all players, splits one integer
// work budget between them, and gives each a slice; flagged requests get five
// times the share. Each search then runs until its slice is spent and resumes
// next tick. Requests are keyed by unit id and visited in that order, so the
// whole thing is deterministic and safe to run inside the lockstep sim.
//
// We depart from retail in ONE way: at most kMaxActiveSearches run at a time,
// and the rest wait their turn. Two reasons, and neither costs throughput.
//
// MEMORY. The per-cell scratch is the expensive part of a PathSearch -- two
// uint32 stamp arrays and two byte arrays, 10 bytes per map cell. That is
// 360 KiB per search on a 192x192 map (measured), so one-search-per-pending-
// request makes footprint a product of map area and how many units happen to be
// ordered at once: ~176 MB for 500 pending, on the referee as well as every
// client. Only the active searches now own scratch, and they own it in a POOL
// that is reused, so a completed request hands its arrays to the next one
// instead of freeing and reallocating them.
//
// BUDGET. `quantum = max(1, budget / share)` is not a cap: once share exceeds
// the budget every request still gets 1, so total work per tick grows without
// limit as requests pile up. Bounding the active set bounds `share`, which
// makes the budget mean what it says.
//
// Throughput is unaffected because the budget is fixed either way: running 100
// searches at 1/100th speed each and running them 12 at a time finish the whole
// set at the same tick. Bounding only changes the ORDER -- and it improves the
// early latencies, since a search that gets a real slice finishes in a tick or
// two instead of all of them crawling together.
//
// Admission rotates (admitCursor_) rather than always starting at the lowest
// unit id, so a busy low-numbered unit cannot starve a high-numbered one. The
// cursor is an integer advanced in map order: deterministic, like the rest.
// How many corners RECONSTRUCTION may hand back. This is NOT the navigator's
// 64-waypoint limit -- that still applies to the route actually installed (see the
// shortcut in World). The two were the same number, and that was the bug: the raw
// trace was truncated to 64 BEFORE the world smoothed it, so a trip across open
// ground lost its destination to a staircase that smoothing collapses to a single
// segment.
//
// Measured on an open-ground staircase (a goal that is neither cardinal nor 45
// degrees makes the march alternate two directions, so every step is a corner):
//
//   grid      raw corners   truncated route ended   goal        discarded
//   80x80        79           (64,32)               (79,39)      15,7 cells
//   160x160     159           (64,32)               (159,79)     95,47 cells

//
// The cut is at a FIXED distance however far the goal is, and every one of those
// corners is on open ground -- so smoothing first reduces the whole trip to one
// segment and the cap never engages at all.
