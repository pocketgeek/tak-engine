// MAP SCENARIO (protocol 259): what a map's own scenario would do if a room turned it
// on -- read from the map's .ota, .crt and Use Only .tdf alone, without building a world.
//
// One inspector serves the create screens (the map list's marker and the selected map's
// button), the room's rule lines and seat tags, the server's START checks, the lobby
// capacity and the tests. It is deliberately separate from setupMatch, which mixes the
// same checks with world mutations (custom stats, the neutral owner); scenario_info_test
// keeps the two in agreement: with a registry, status Ok exactly when setupMatch with
// MatchConfig::mapScenario does not refuse the map (placement bounds aside, below).
//
// Not part of the hashed simulation: nothing here touches a World.
