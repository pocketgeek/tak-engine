// The server's account file, and the brute-force throttle that guards it.
//
// Accounts live in one plain-text config file -- no database. It holds, per
// account, a random salt and the two SCRAM verifiers; the password itself is not
// in it and cannot be derived from it (see `src/net/auth.h`). The file is still
// sensitive, because it is exactly what an offline guessing attack would run
// against, so it is written 0600 and never logged.
