// takserver: the central multiplayer server (docs/multiplayer-design.md, M3).
//
// A network poll loop hosts the lobby; each running game has its own worker. Each game
// is a server-sequenced deterministic lockstep: clients send commands, the
// server buckets them per tick, closes one tick every 1/30 s, and broadcasts a
// TickBundle to every client in the game. Clients advance their sims in step.
//
// With --data the server runs a REFEREE sim (a headless World built by the same
// setupMatch the clients use) that also hosts the AI players: each tick the AI
// controllers append their orders to the bundle, and the referee's own state
// hash is the canonical one clients are checked against (with a suspicion rule
// that blames the referee if every client agrees against it). Without --data the
// server is a pure relay and clients cross-check hashes among themselves (M3).
