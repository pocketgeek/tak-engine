#pragma once

// The build profiles of OUR AI levels (Defensive, Easy, Normal, Hard, Absurd,
// Absurdly Defensive): per-unit weight and limit, built into the engine.
//
// These levels never read a game's ai/default.txt. Each has its own built-in table
// (builtinProfile). ONE file, ai/takengine.txt, adjusts all six of them: a GAME MOD
// or the room's MAP PACKAGE may carry it in its ai/ folder -- loose in a game-mod
// pack folder (mods/game/<pack>/ai/takengine.txt), at ai/ inside an archive in a
// game mod, or at ai/ in the map's .kmp (it travels in the room's map package,
// net/mappackage.h).
//
// Each level applies the file's lines on top of its OWN built-in table, so the levels
// keep their differences (and paramsFor's per-level limit scaling still applies): a
// `weight` or `limit` line replaces that unit's entry in every level, and every other
// unit keeps each level's built-in values (`limit <unit> 0` keeps every level from
// building that unit). A game mod's file wins over the map's (the map's is read only
// when no game mod supplies one). A file of that name anywhere else (a pack's root,
// another folder) is not read, and the base install and cosmetic packs can never
// supply one. The old per-level files (ai/d.txt, ai/e.txt, ai/n.txt, ai/h.txt,
// ai/a.txt, ai/ad.txt) are no longer read.
// Classic (retail's own AI, shown to players as RETAIL) is not built in and never
// reads ai/takengine.txt: it reads ai/<aiprofile>.txt, else the game's
// ai/default.txt (ai/classicprofile.h).
//
// Line format (the one loadProfile has always read): `weight <unit> <n>` or
// `limit <unit> <n>`, whitespace-separated, unit names case-insensitive; a line
// starting with '/' and anything that is not one of the two keywords is skipped,
// and a later line for the same unit and keyword wins.
//
// Server-side only (an AI input, never part of the gameplay-data hash).
