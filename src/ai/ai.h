// The skirmish AI, extracted from the SDL viewer so it can also run headless on
// the multiplayer server. A Controller reads a const World and EMITS net::Commands
// through a sink instead of mutating the world directly -- so the same AI drives
// a player whether the commands are applied in-process (single-player) or fed into
// the server's command sequencer (server-hosted AI). See docs/multiplayer-design.md.
//
// The AI runs ONLY on the server (the referee), never on clients: its *decisions*
// are server-local, and only the net::Commands it emits are relayed and applied by
// every peer -- so lockstep never depends on the AI being reproducible. We still
// keep it RNG-driven so a --mpai run is repeatable for testing.
