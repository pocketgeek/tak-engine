# Retail engine notes (`KINGDOMS.icd`)

Findings from a static analysis of the retail *Total Annihilation: Kingdoms*
executable — `Kingdoms.exe` is a small stub loader; `KINGDOMS.icd` is the real
2.27 MB PE32 (i386, MSVC release build, ImageBase `0x400000`). The build kept its
C++ RTTI and a number of debug-`printf` strings, which together expose the class
model, the config-key schema, and several gameplay formulas. `ironplague.icd` is
the Iron Plague expansion on the same engine.

Analysis was static only — strings, RTTI names, and disassembly of specific code
paths read against the game's own data files. No engine code or assets are
reproduced here; this documents an interface for a clean-room recreation.

## Technology stack (imports)

- **DirectDraw** (`DDRAW.dll`) — a *software* 2.5D renderer; no Direct3D. An
  optional **Glide** path (`glide2x/3x`) targets 3dfx Voodoo. The 3DO models are
  CPU-rasterised to sprites, which is the source of the isometric look.
- **DirectPlay** (`DPLAYX`) + WinSock — networking. The sim is deterministic
  lockstep over discrete *game ticks* (`"…sent more than %lu game ticks ago"`).
- **Miles Sound System** (`mss32`) — audio. **Bink** (`binkw32`) — cutscene video.
- A hot-loaded `Fire.dll` renders flame/particle surfaces (`FireSurfHandler`).

## Object model (from RTTI — 226 game classes)

**Weapons** — `WeaponType` maps one subclass per FBI `type`/`subtype`:
`Melee`, `Ballistic`, `DroppedBallistic` (bombs), `Guided` (homing), `Wandering`,
`RemoteEffect`, `LineOfSight` (hitscan: `Fire`/`Lightning`/`MindControl`/
`TurnToFrozen`/`TurnToStone`), `Earthquake`, `Hailstorm`, `AreaMindControl`,
`AreaTurnToFrozen`, and `ATTRIBUTE_ADJUSTER` (stat buffs). **Status effects and
capture are weapon subtypes**, not unit flags (`turntostone`, `turntofrozen`,
`paralyze`, `mindcontrol` are real data values).

**Navigation** — `PathNavigator` / `VTOLNavigator` with `Local*` vs `Remote*`
variants (the lockstep prediction split); `NavGoalCircle/Rect/Ring` are
area-shaped move goals.

**AI** — role-based squads: `AIBaseSquad` (defence), `AIBackupSquad`,
`AIStrikeSquad`, `AIVTOLSquad` (air).

**Particles/SFX** — `BuildEnergy`, `DamageFlame`, `DeadSpray`, `Flame`, `Smoke`,
`Spray`, `Circle`, `Hail`, `Wake` (ship wakes), plus texture emitters.

**Missions** — one class per victory/defeat condition (`KillEnemyCommander`,
`MoveUnitToRadius`, `CaptureUnitType`, `DeathTimerRunsOut`, …).

## Formulas (disassembled)

**Veterancy** (`getLevel @0x519310`, `getMult @0x5193c0`), constants read from
`.data`/`.rdata`:

```
level = min(kills, 10)                 // one level per kill, cap 10
mult  = 1.0 + 0.10 * level             // base 1.0, +10%/level → up to 2.0×
```

The multiplier scales the instance's **attack** and **armour** up and **divides**
a reload/cooldown field (veterans hit harder, tank more, fire faster); max HP is
unchanged. `noveteran` opts out; `veteranmodel` swaps the mesh at max rank.

**Build/repair rate** (`@0x4d4b30`, the `hp=%i buildtime=%i buildrate=%i` system):

```
rate = round( vetMult * targetMaxHP * workertime * param * (1/3000) ), min 1
```

**Damage** has no single formula — each `WeaponType` subclass applies damage
through its own virtual method; all paths route through the attacker's
veteran-scaled attack and the victim's veteran-scaled armour, on top of the
per-target `DAMAGE` category table.

## Config schema

The TDF parser (`readInt @0x543190`, `readFloat @0x5431c0`, `readString @0x5432c0`)
recognises **336 keys**. The recreation's stat model was validated field-for-field
against the engine's own debug dumps (`Damage/Reload/ManaPerShot`,
`Range/Velocity/AreaOfEffect`, `MaxMana/ManaRecharge`,
`MaxVel(water,road)/ManeuverLeash`, `hp/buildtime/buildrate`). Some `UNIT_DEF`
offsets: `maxdamage +0x1be`, `experiencepoints +0x1c2`, `workertime +0x21a`;
weapon `range +0x90`, `damage +0x126`. Keys the shipped data never uses but the
engine supports: `kamikaze`, `digger`, `teleporter`, `amphibious`, `antiweapons`,
`toairweapon`, `immunetoparalyzer`, `burst`/`burstrate`, `weaponswitching`, …

## Data layout the engine reads

`*.hpi` (SQSH archives, checksummed) · `units/*.fbi` · `MOVEINFO.tdf` (movement
classes → the real `maxslope`/`max·minwaterdepth`) · `gamedata/SIDEDATA.tdf` ·
`gamedata/Gods.tdf` (god timing) · `gamedata/{explosions,effects,damageflames,
soundclasses}/*.tdf` · `CanBuild/<builder>/*.tdf` · `Maps/*.ota` + `*.tnt` ·
`*.gaf`/`*.taf`/`*.3do`/`*.cob`.

## Weapon in-range model (icd, 2026-09-10)

The in-range predicate is a per-weapon-subclass virtual (vtable slots 3/4;
MeleeWeapon vtable `0x5f3af8`, base WeaponType `0x5f3710`):

- **Base `WeaponType::inRange` @0x530580** (point variant @0x530500): `range==0`
  → always true; else strictly **2D centre-to-centre** from the two units'
  position dwords (`unit+0x68` x, `+0x70` z, 16.16 fixed; y at `+0x6c` is
  skipped), 64-bit squared compare `(dx²+dz²)>>32 <= range²` (inclusive). Used
  unchanged by Guided/LineOfSight/Wandering weapons. No footprint subtraction,
  no weapon-piece origin.
- **BallisticWeapon @0x52bc60**: solves the launch arc first (helper `0x52bd10`,
  the only user of dy; `0x8000` = no solution → out of range), then falls
  through to the base centre test.
- **MeleeWeapon @0x52b980** (point @0x52b8a0): **never reads `range`**. Each
  unit's footprint box is position ∓ `foot<<19` (∓ 8px·footCells, cell-snapped);
  in range iff on BOTH axes `|centreΔ| − halfA − halfB < 0x80000` (= 8 px) —
  i.e. the boxes are within half a cell of touching. (`range` in melee TDFs —
  10..250 in shipped data — is dead weight.)
- Weapon TDF parse @0x530780: `range` readInt → `[WeaponType+0x90]`, clamped
  min 2; `minrange` → `+0x94`. Unit-def weapon-type pointers at `+0x1aa`
  (3 dwords). Range-ring UI strings @0x4d6823; debug dump @0x4fbf6b.

## Ship / no-walk mover animation (icd + COB, 2026-09-10)

Ships have no `walk` script. The engine drives them with the **`MoveRate`**
callin on move start/stop (arg > 0 = moving); the COB's `Create` ambients
(`MotionControl`, wake/oar controllers) poll the static that `MoveRate` sets
and select `slowrow`/`row`/`fastrow` from **`GET_UNIT_VALUE 29`** (current
speed, thresholds 25/75 ⇒ percent of max). `TurnDirection(deg)` steers the
rudder/sail trim; `WindChange` orients sails/flags (FBI `wind=1`). Resetting
such a unit's VM kills the Create ambients permanently — nothing restarts them.

Asked because our own movement had become the dominant sim cost. It turns out
we diverged from retail badly here, and the divergence is what costs us.

**No pathfinding class exists.** Of the 356 RTTI class names in the binary, the
only movement-related ones are `Navigator`, `PathNavigator`,
`RemotePathNavigator`, `VTOLNavigator`, `LocalVTOLNavigator`,
`RemoteVTOLNavigator`, and the goal shapes `NavGoal`, `NavGoalCircle`,
`NavGoalRect`, `NavGoalRing`, `NavGoalVTOL`, `NavGoalVTOLm`. There is no
`PathFinder`, `Route`, `Waypoint`, `Region`, `Sector` or graph class of any
kind. (`Local*`/`Remote*` is the lockstep prediction split.)

**`PathNavigator` contains no search.** Its vftable is at `0x5f2a24`; every
method is small (11-365 instructions) and nearly loop-free. The largest, slot 8
`0x4e5700`, is a bit-stream serialiser (word/bit cursor, `1 << bit`, wrap at 32,
grow buffer) -- navigator state being saved, not a solver.

**The navigator object**, as read off slots 1 and 2:

| offset  | meaning                                                        |
|---------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| `+0x04` | the `NavGoal` (area goal: circle / rect / ring)                |
| `+0x08` | unit                                                            |
| `+0x08 + 4*i` | a SHORT array of 16-bit (x,z) points, i indexed by +0x10c |
| `+0x10c`| how many points are live (tested against 2 and 3)              |
| `+0x110`| tick stamp; cleared when older than `globalTick - 6`           |
| `+0x114`| flag bits (bit0 = target valid, bit3, bit4)                    |

**Per-tick update** is slot 2, `0x4e5150`: ask the goal via its vtable whether
it is satisfied (`[goal+0x10]`, `[goal+0x2c]`), then

```
movsx edx, word [esi+0x12]   ; target z        movsx eax, word [unit+0x72] ; unit z
movsx ecx, word [unit+0x6a]  ; unit x          sub / imul / imul / add     ; dx^2 + dz^2
cmp   edx, 0x19              ; <= 25  ->  arrived (radius 5)
```

**Steering** is slot 1, `0x4e54e0`: fetch the goal point through the NavGoal
vtable (`[goal+0x20]`), compute float deltas to it, and set the current target
point, stamping `+0x110` with the tick. The stamp's 6-tick expiry is the whole
re-plan cadence.

**So retail steers each unit toward an AREA GOAL, keeping at most two or three
intermediate points, refreshed about every 6 ticks.** No global search, no
precomputed connectivity, nothing shared between units. That is why it ran
hundreds of units on a 1999 Pentium, and it matches the TA-family feel: fluid
local movement that occasionally wedges.

**What we used to do instead, and no longer do.** This paragraph described
full-map Dijkstra FLOW FIELDS per (domain, footprint, goal block) plus per-unit
A*, flow fields being our own invention (added 2026-09-03 for a crowd/corner
jam) and costing ~59% of server stalled time after four rounds of optimisation.
THE FLOW FIELDS ARE GONE (cf316fb). The search is now a port of retail's own
tracer -- see src/sim/pathsearch.h, which carries the icd entry points -- and
the crowd jam they existed to paper over turned out to be a symptom of our
movement model, which has since been replaced by retail's.

NOT established: whether some free function (not a class) does a coarse global
search somewhere. None was found, and the absence of any search-shaped routine
in the navigator region is strong negative evidence, but it is not proof.

## Movement: the local steerer (icd, 2026-09-12, PARTIAL)

Follow-on from the section above. Retail has no path search, so everything that
gets a unit around an obstacle lives in the mover, and this is what that mover
is built out of. Addresses are entry points; the direction-choosing logic that
consumes them is only partly mapped, so treat the last section as a lead rather
than a spec.

**`0x507fb0` -- area rater.** Walks a RECTANGLE of map cells (14-byte records,
stride `0xe`) in a nested row/column loop and takes the MINIMUM score over it:

```
test byte [esi+0xd], 0x80    ; per-cell flag (road)
jne  keep                    ; road keeps the higher score
cmp  dword [edi], 6          ; running minimum
jle  keep
mov  dword [edi], 6          ; ordinary ground clamps it to 6
add  esi, 0xe                ; next cell
```

So ordinary ground scores 6 and road 7 -- the 1.2x road preference our
NavGrid::setRoads comment already cites. The score is GRADED, not boolean.

**`0x4db640` -- passability query.** Calls the rater, returns early if it comes
back `-1` (impassable terrain), then walks the live-unit list checking flag
`0x1000000` at `+0x130`. So one call answers "can a body of this size stand
here, and what does it cost", terrain and occupancy together. This is where
"a parked unit is impassable, a moving one merely expensive" is expressed: the
occupant lowers the score rather than vetoing the cell.

**The threshold is 4.** Every caller compares the result against it
(`cmp eax, 4` / `jle` / `jl`), so the scale is: -1 impassable, below 4 refused,
4..5 passable but costly, 6 ground, 7 road.

**`0x4dba80` -- the mover.** Two uses of the query are clear:

  * Forward probe: take the unit's heading from `+0x7e`, project one step of
    `0x100000` through the sin/cos tables (`0x5360bf` / `0x5360f3`), and query
    the resulting position. `cmp eax,4 / jle` -> blocked.
  * A 3x3 neighbourhood scan: outer loop over x offset -1..+1, inner over z
    offset -1..+1 in `0x100000` steps, querying each and bailing on the first
    below threshold.

**Blocked -> re-read own waypoints, clamp, slow.** When the forward probe fails
the mover sets one of two refusal states (flags `0x100` / `0x200` at navigator
`+0x36`, each accumulating a per-type value from `UnitType+0x249` into `+0x30`
-- the clamp-and-slow already ported in 080d288), runs the 3x3 scan, and then
calls navigator vtable slot 3 with `(outBuf, 3)`:

```
mov  ebx, [ebp+0xc]              ; arg2 = 3, how many points wanted
mov  eax, [ecx+0x10c]            ; the waypoint COUNT
cmp  esi, eax / lea edi,[eax-1]  ; clamp the index to count-1
movsx eax, word [ecx+edi*4+0xc]  ; point[i].x, the same 16-bit array
shl  eax, 0x10                   ; -> 16.16 world units
movsx eax, word [ecx+edi*4+0xe]  ; point[i].z
```

That is an ACCESSOR: it exports the navigator's own two-point segment as world
coordinates. `Navigator`'s base version is `ret 8`, a stub, and all four
NavGoal shapes share an unrelated `mov eax,1; ret`. So the goal object is NOT
consulted here and is not an active participant -- an earlier revision of this
document said it was, on a misread of which object the vtable belonged to.

CONCLUSION SO FAR, and it is uncomfortable: no distinct obstacle-avoidance
algorithm has been found. What retail has is the graded passability score, the
forward probe, the 3x3 scan, and clamp-and-slow -- all of which we now have.
Either the avoidance is subtler than these pieces suggest (the 3x3 scan's
result is used somewhere not yet traced), or retail genuinely wedged as much
as we do and the difference we think we remember is not there. Resolving that
needs the rest of 0x4dba80's control flow read properly, not more guessing.

### RESOLVED (2026-09-16): retail genuinely wedges. There is no avoidance.

The second reading was right, and the 3x3 scan's result goes nowhere.

Follow the scan to its blocked exit. `0x4dbcf9` (`cmp eax,4` / `jl`) leaves the
loop for `0x4dbe2c`, and that block is five instructions long: load the
navigator, read `+0x36`, `and $0xff3f`, `or $0x20`, store it back, and RETURN.
No position is touched, no route is requested, nothing is queued.

So the scan's only product is bit `0x20` at navigator `+0x36` -- and nothing
reads it. Every access to `+0x36` in the navigator's own address range
(0x4db000-0x4e6000) was checked: the reads there are the mover's own
clear-on-entry (`andw $0xf81f` at 0x4dbaa8) and its refusal writes. The three
`test $0x20,%al` sites in the range are a different structure entirely --
`0x13c(%edx,%eax,1)`, not a navigator field.

That completes the picture the rest of this section describes. A blocked retail
unit sets a status bit nobody consumes, clamps, slows (0.5x on the first
refusal, 0.4x once refused twice), and presses on. It does not dodge, it does
not sidestep, and it does not ask for a new route -- re-requests are on their
own 120-tick cadence and only fire when the path did not fail.

The practical consequence, for anyone tempted to add avoidance back: our own
sideways-teleport "unstick" was not restoring a retail behaviour, it was
inventing one, and it was hiding a real defect (a degenerate axis slide that
displaced -0.0002px and so never registered as blocked). Both are gone as of
10f1e1c. Head-on columns wedging is retail behaviour, not a regression.

## RETRACTED: the "wall-follower" is not in the movement path (2026-09-12)

An earlier version of this section claimed that `0x4140d4`..`0x414eb0` is
retail's answer to a blocked unit -- a wall-following obstacle tracer -- and
that implementing it would fix units stopping dead at a parked body. **That
claim is withdrawn.** The code exists and does what was described, but it is
not reachable from unit movement, so it is no evidence about how retail moves
anything.

What the routine genuinely is: a contour tracer. `0x5f304c` / `0x5f3054` really
are the 8-direction offset tables
(`dx = {0,-1,-1,-1,0,1,1,1}`, `dz = {-1,-1,0,1,1,1,0,-1}`, compass order),
the direction at `+0x108` really is rotated and masked `& 7`, candidates really
are scored against the threshold 4, and it really does give up on returning to
its start cell facing its start direction, within a time-sliced step budget
(`+0x48` against the cap at `+0x165`, phase at `+0x60`). All of that held up.

What was never checked: whether anything in the movement path calls it. It does
not. An upward reachability sweep of the whole call graph gives `0x4146e0` just
NINE ancestor functions in the entire binary --
`0x415b10, 0x416430, 0x4261f0, 0x4f6c70, 0x526310, 0x526740, 0x527060,
0x527360` -- and the mover (`0x4dba80`), the navigator update (`0x4dc800`) and
the passability query (`0x4db640`) are none of them. `0x4261f0` is a handler in
the CHEAT dispatch table at `0x605c2c`, whose neighbouring entries are the
strings "HalfShot", "NowISee", "MakePoster" and "ManaMe". This is map/poster
rendering or a similar offline analysis, not steering.

The methodological error is worth naming, because it is the second time in one
day: the routine was found by searching for callers of a function believed to be
movement-related, and its shape (direction tables, passability threshold, give-up
test) was so convincingly "obstacle avoidance" that the shape was accepted as
proof of purpose. Shape is not provenance. Establish the CALL PATH from the
subsystem you care about before concluding a routine belongs to it.

Still true: `0x4139d0` is a per-cell query rather than a search, so the old
`sim.h` note calling it "its path search" remains wrong.

### What a second, top-down pass established (same day)

Working DOWN from the navigator instead of up from a suggestive routine:

  * **The navigator holds up to 64 waypoints, not two.** `0x4e4ea0` is its
    point-list setter: it clamps the incoming count at `0x40` and block-copies
    that many dwords into `+0xc`, storing the count at `+0x10c`. So the
    "two-point segment `[position, goal]`" description -- which I restated as
    recently as the retraction above -- is wrong as a statement about the
    navigator. `movl $0x2,0x10c` at `0x4e5635` is just ONE caller installing
    two points. The navigator is a general multi-waypoint follower, and the
    mover's `pop_front(1)`-then-recurse (`0x4dbf36` / `0x4dbf7e`, vtable slot
    11 = `0x4e50a0`) is it advancing along that list.
  * **The mover's refusal flags are write-only.** Nothing in the binary reads
    bit `0x20`, `0x100` or `0x200` of navigator `+0x36`. The mover clears
    `0x07E0` on entry and sets them on refusal, and no consumer exists. They
    are status, not control -- so the response to being blocked is entirely
    inside the mover: clamp, slow (the `+0x30` budget against the global at
    `[0x62d55c+0x19f44]`), return.
  * **A real route producer exists** and feeds the navigator: `0x414450`,
    `0x415040`, `0x415b10` and `0x416430` all call the setter above, and that
    cluster contains the contour tracer retracted earlier. So the tracer IS
    part of route production; it simply is not reached FROM the mover, which
    is why the reachability test that produced the retraction was the wrong
    test.

### RESOLVED: retail HAS a pathfinder, reached through a singleton pointer

The link is not a call at all, which is why a direct-call graph could never
find it. It is a GLOBAL POINTER.

  * `0x4e6060` does `new(0x22b)` and runs `0x415f80` on the result -- a
    constructor, zeroing `+0x0..+0x28` -- then stores the object into the
    global slot `[0x62d55c + 0x19e70]`. That is a SINGLETON of the
    `0x414450 / 0x415040 / 0x415b10 / 0x416430` class, the same class that
    owns the contour tracer at `0x4146e0`.
  * The navigator's `setDestination` (vtable slot 1, `0x4e54e0`) loads that
    same singleton at `0x4e5502` and calls `0x415f30` on it -- cancel/re-register
    the pending request for this navigator. `0x416430` calls `0x415f30` too,
    which is the completion side.
  * The singleton installs results back into a navigator through `0x4e4ea0`,
    the point-list setter that accepts up to 64 waypoints.
  * When no route is available, `setDestination` falls back at `0x4e5632` to
    `count = 2` -- the unit's own cell and the goal -- and that fallback is
    SKIPPED when bit 0 of `+0x114` says a real route is already in hand.

So the shape is: an asynchronous path request against a singleton pathfinder,
a multi-waypoint route installed when it completes, and a straight two-point
segment as the interim fallback.

**This overturns "retail has no path search of any kind."** That claim was
made earlier today, written into this file, and used to justify setting
`pathBudget_ = 0` in our sim -- i.e. no route search at runtime, units steer
straight at the goal. It is wrong. The earlier `sim.h` note, which said retail
bakes per-class grids and "its path search reads that", was closer to the truth
than the claim that replaced it.

The two-point segment reading was not wrong, but it was the FALLBACK, not the
mechanism -- observed at the one call site that installs it and generalised.

Not yet established: what the search actually optimises, how requests are
scheduled and throttled, and how the tracer participates. Those need their own
pass. What IS established is that runtime routing exists, so our
`pathBudget_ = 0` is a deviation from retail rather than fidelity to it.

### The pathfinder, end to end (2026-09-12)

Complete architecture, established by following the singleton rather than the
call graph. Addresses are entry points unless noted.

**The object.** `[0x62d55c + 0x19e70]` holds a singleton, `new(0x22b)` +
constructor `0x415f80`, created at `0x4e6060` and cleared at `0x4e60b6`.

**Configuration** (`0x4252e0`): reads a setting, then
`+0x221` = base work budget, `+0x225` = `base * clamp(pct, 5, 1000) / 100`,
with two booleans at `+0x229` / `+0x22a` for the -2 / -1 / 0 special values.
So pathfinding effort is a user-facing quality knob.

**Per-frame scheduler** (`0x416430`): walks the request lists of all 10
players, counting pending requests into two buckets -- `B` for those flagged at
`+0x24e7`, `A` for the rest. If none, it bumps an idle counter at `+0x1a5` and
returns. Otherwise the per-request quantum is

    quantum = +0x225 / (A + 5*B)

so a flagged request gets FIVE TIMES the share. It zeroes `+0x165`, which is
the work cap the search meters itself against, then iterates the players.

**Where we deliberately depart** (2026-09-12): retail lets every pending request
hold a live search. We cap the concurrent searches at `kMaxActiveSearches` (12)
and queue the rest. Two reasons, neither of which costs throughput:

  * The per-cell scratch is the expensive part of a search -- 10 bytes per map
    cell, measured at 360 KiB on a 192x192 map -- so one search per pending
    request makes memory a product of map area and how many units happen to be
    ordered at once (~176 MB at 500 pending, on the referee and every client
    alike). Only active searches hold scratch now, out of a reused pool.
  * `quantum = max(1, budget / (A + 5B))` is not a cap. Once `A + 5B` exceeds
    the budget every request still receives 1, so the total work per tick grows
    without limit as requests pile up. Bounding the active set bounds `A + 5B`,
    which is what makes the budget a cap.

Throughput is unchanged because the budget is fixed either way: 100 searches at
1/100th speed each and 12 at a time finish the whole set on the same tick.
Bounding changes only the ORDER, and it improves early latencies. Admission
rotates (`admitCursor_`) so a busy low unit id cannot starve a high one, and it
is integer state walked in map order, so every peer admits the same requests on
the same tick. This changes the sim hash ONLY in scenarios that exceed 12
concurrent searches; the `--mpai` baseline is unaffected.

**Per-request step** (`0x415b10`): runs one search step and switches on it --
`-2` = failed (sets `+0x5c`), `-1` = not finished (charges 30 to the work
counter `+0x48`, expands, retries via `0x414450` / `0x415f10`), `0` = done,
build the route and install it.

**The search itself** (`0x4146e0`) is NOT A*. There is no open list, no
priority queue and no cost-to-goal ordering anywhere in it. It is an
incremental obstacle-boundary tracer:

  * state machine at `+0x60` (0 = init, then 1..3);
  * `0x413e50` returns distance to the goal, and `+0xcc` keeps the BEST
    (minimum) distance reached so far -- the characteristic bookkeeping of a
    "bug" algorithm that follows an obstacle outline and leaves it when it can
    improve on its closest approach;
  * movement uses the 8-direction tables `0x5f304c` / `0x5f3054`
    (`dx = {0,-1,-1,-1,0,1,1,1}`, `dz = {-1,-1,0,1,1,1,0,-1}`, compass order)
    with the direction at `+0x108` rotated and masked `& 7`;
  * every candidate cell is scored by `0x4139d0` against the threshold 4;
  * it terminates on returning to its start cell facing its start direction;
  * it is time-sliced: work accumulates into `+0x48` and the step returns once
    it passes the cap the scheduler wrote to `+0x165`, resuming next frame.

**Hand-off to the navigator.** On success the route is installed through
`0x4e4ea0`, which clamps at 64 waypoints. The navigator's `setDestination`
(vtable slot 1, `0x4e54e0`) cancels/registers with the singleton via
`0x415f30`, and installs a straight TWO-POINT segment -- own cell plus goal --
at `0x4e5632` as the interim, skipping it when bit 0 of `+0x114` says a real
route is already in hand. The mover walks the list, popping via slot 11
(`0x4e50a0`).

So: asynchronous, budgeted, incremental boundary-tracing search; straight-line
movement until it returns; up to 64 waypoints when it does.

**Two of my own claims this file carried are now settled.** "Retail has no path
search of any kind" was wrong -- routing exists. But the observation behind it
was right: there is no A*, no open list, no priority queue. Both halves matter,
and conflating "no A*" with "no pathfinding" is what produced the error. And
the retraction that said the tracer at `0x4146e0` is not in the movement path
was itself wrong: it is the search. It is not reached FROM the mover, which is
what I tested; it is reached from the scheduler, and its output is handed to
the navigator that the mover then follows.

### The search algorithm in detail, and the port plan (2026-09-12)

`0x4146e0` is a two-phase incremental "bug" search over the 16px cell grid,
driven by a state machine at `+0x60`.

**State 0 -- init.** `0x413e50(start)` gives distance to the goal, kept as the
running BEST in `+0xcc`; zero means already there. Score the start cell with
`0x4139d0`; below 4 it gives up immediately. Otherwise seed `+0xd0/+0xd4` with
the start cell and go to state 1.

**State 1 -- greedy march** (8 work per step). Take the delta from the current
cell to the goal, convert it to one of 8 compass directions with `0x415040`,
step, and score the destination with `0x4139d0`:

  * `< 4` -- blocked. Record the current cell as the trace origin in
    `+0xf0/+0xf4` and switch to state 2.
  * `== 4` -- passable but occupied. Bump `+0xd8`; on the 3rd, switch to
    tracing as above.
  * `== 7` -- road. Bump `+0xe0`.
  * otherwise -- ordinary ground. Bump `+0xdc`; on the 3rd, switch to tracing.

Reaching the goal (`+0xcc == 0`) writes the cell to `+0x34/+0x36` and returns
-1, which the caller treats as "a waypoint was produced, keep going".

**State 2 -- cardinal march** (7 work per step). NOT a trace setup, which is
how I first read it. From the current origin `+0xf0/+0xf4` it steps one cell in
the cardinal direction toward the goal, and on each cell it lays a BREADCRUMB:
a bit in the map at `+0x2c`, and a 4-byte record at `+0x1c` whose second byte
is the direction it entered from. Reaching a cell flagged `0x4` -- the goal --
ends the whole search. When the next cell is blocked it starts the traces.

**State 3 -- TWIN boundary traces** (9 work per step). Retail runs two cursors
at once, `+0xf8/+0xfc` and `+0x100/+0x104`, with directions `+0x108` and
`+0x10c`, sweeping in OPPOSITE senses: `0x414c52` rotates by -2/-3 and
`0x414e23` by +2/+3. Each probes with the 8-direction tables against the usual
threshold 4 and lays the same breadcrumbs. Whichever cursor first regains the
straight line from the origin to the goal wins: `0x414fde` and `0x414ff8` copy
that cursor's cell into `+0xf0/+0xf4` and drop back to state 2. The M-line test
itself is at `0x414dc4..0x414df4` -- normalise the signs so the goal delta is
positive, then accept a cell lying along the first leg or at the far x with z
in range. Running both hands at once is what lets it round a wall from whichever
end is nearer.

**The route is reconstructed from the breadcrumbs**, not accumulated as it
goes: `0x414450` walks back from the goal through the per-cell direction bytes.
That per-cell "first visit wins" discipline is load-bearing -- overwrite the
direction on a revisit and the parent map grows cycles, which in our port
produced a 4-cell loop repeated out to the 64-waypoint clamp while still
reporting success.

**Two limits.** Work accumulates in `+0x48` and the step returns once it
crosses the per-request cap in `+0x165`, resuming next frame with all state
intact. Separately `+0xe4` counts cells visited and bails against `+0xe8`.

**Return protocol** (consumed by `0x415b10`): `0` done, `-1` a waypoint was
emitted at `+0x34/+0x36` (the caller charges a further 30 work and appends it),
`-2` OUT OF QUANTUM -- suspend and resume next frame. An earlier note in this
file called `-2` "failed"; it is not. `0x415028` returns it from the work-cap
check, and the caller's `+0x5c` is a still-pending marker, not an error.

**The budget is an INTEGER, not wall-clock.** `0x41617b` seeds both `+0x221`
and `+0x225` with `0x2ee0` = 12000 work units per frame, and the quality
setting scales it by a percentage. Nothing here reads a timer. That matters
enormously for us: a faithful port is deterministic by construction and safe
for lockstep, provided the budget is a match-replicated constant and requests
are visited in a fixed (player, unit id) order.

### Port status (2026-09-12): ON by default

`setupMatch` enables it. What it does, measured end to end on Inner Circle with
the service off vs on, same start and goal:

    goal + 40 cells:  35% of the way  ->  97% of the way
    goal + 20 cells:  70%             ->  70%   (unchanged)
    goal + 80 cells:  19%             ->  19%   (unchanged)

So it works where the search succeeds, and changes nothing where it fails --
the unit keeps the straight segment it always had.

**The failures are largely inherent, not bugs.** March-plus-wall-follow cannot
solve NESTED obstacles, and the 20- and 80-cell cases on Inner Circle run into
exactly that: a mazey field where the outline a cursor is following contains
further obstacles. Retail's own `(w+h)*20` visit limit (`0x414797`) abandons
those too. A bug algorithm is not a planner and was never going to be one.

**Wandering routes are retail's too.** The 30-cell route comes back with 64
corners looping well past the goal, which looked like a defect until reading
`0x414450`: the original records a waypoint only on a direction change, exactly
as we do, applies no smoothing, keeps the last 64 in a RING buffer (`& 0x3f`),
and merely sets a "this route is a detour" flag on the unit when the step count
exceeds the manhattan estimate. Retail tolerates wandering routes; so do we, and
the unit still gets there -- 97% of the way on a route that wanders.

**Failure backoff matters more than it sounds.** A search that failed from
roughly here will fail again, so a unit stuck against a maze sat re-requesting
every 30 ticks and ate the whole budget. Backing off 150 ticks after a failure
cut the benchmark from 23.2ms/tick to 22.1 while keeping the +40 result at 97%.

Cost: 22.1ms/tick at 2217 units against a ~19.5ms baseline at ~2000, so roughly
+1 to +2.5ms depending on how you weigh the unit-count difference. That buys
units that actually arrive. The `--mpai` hash moves to 9179fe05b490297b,
reproducible run to run, and the cross-compiler golden is untouched.

Still open: whether our cursors wander further than retail's. The route builder
and the termination test are now confirmed to match, so if there is a remaining
divergence it is inside the trace's stepping, and it would show up as route
quality rather than as failure.

### The unstick pass is gone, and what is still broken (2026-09-12)

Retail has no "unstick" pass, and neither do we any more. Ours nudged any ground
unit standing on a blocked cell toward the nearest walkable one, to rescue
bodies "spawned by a building, shoved by a crowd, or clipped a corner" -- and
two of those three causes were our own (the crowd-shoving one was the separation
pass, also deleted). Worse, the nudge moved a unit every tick, which reads as
progress, which reset the wedged timer, so a unit that could not reach its goal
never gave up.

Three real bugs fell out of chasing a unit that walked for ever without
arriving, and all three are fixed:

  * **The no-headway test compared SQUARED distances** and subtracted 400 for
    "20px closer". At 2900px the squared distance is ~8.6 million, so a
    sub-pixel gain cleared the bar and the timer never accumulated at range.
    Now linear.
  * **A clipped route threw the destination away.** `replaceLeg` marks the last
    waypoint of the installed path as the leg's goal, so a route cut off at the
    64-waypoint limit replaced the player's destination with wherever the route
    happened to stop. The unit walked to each route's end, asked for another, and
    shuffled between them. The true goal is now appended when a route falls
    short.
  * **The final waypoint was snapped to the exact goal unconditionally**, even
    for a clipped route, sending the unit charging at a distant point through
    whatever lay between. Now only when the route really reached the goal cell.

RESOLVED, and my first reading of it was wrong. Appending the destination fixed
the circling; what looked like a livelock afterwards was a 60-SECOND HARNESS
CUTOFF being misread. The unit was converging the whole time -- distance to goal
falling 3282 -> 3220 -> 3126 -> 3023 -> 2931 -> 2861 -> 2741 -- and I read "1873px
travelled, no arrival" as evidence of circling when it was evidence of walking.
Run the same case for 300s and it ARRIVES: 124.3s, 5181px travelled, from a unit
spawned inside rock to the far corner of a 192x192 map.

The lesson worth keeping: total distance travelled is not a stuck-detector. Plot
distance TO THE GOAL over time, or the harness will lie to you.

The retry cadence is also now retail's rather than a guess. `0x4e545b`
re-requests only once the tick counter has passed the stamp at navigator+0x110
by `0x78` -- 120 ticks -- and only when the path did NOT fail, testing the
failed/detour bits first and doing nothing at all if either is set. We had been
re-asking every 30 ticks, four times retail's rate.

Still not attempted: nothing here needs a per-destination timer. I proposed one
while the circling was still unexplained; it was a fix for a bug that turned out
not to exist.

### Clicking somewhere unreachable (2026-09-12)

Reported from play: a Monarch ordered at a mountain shoves at the cliff
indefinitely. My harness said otherwise, because it was testing the wrong thing
-- it ordered a unit at a goal whose whole neighbourhood was rock, and the
reachability test correctly reported "unreachable" and dropped the leg.

A click on a mountain is not that. It lands on a cell no ground unit fits in,
but the reachability test resolves an unstandable goal to the nearest WALKABLE
cell, which is normally on the unit's own side of the mountain -- so it answers
"reachable", quite correctly, and nothing ever declares the order impossible.
The unit then walks up to the rock and pushes.

`order()` now snaps a destination the unit cannot stand on to the nearest cell
it fits in, before the order is queued. The unit walks as close as it can get
and ARRIVES, which is what retail does (observed in play: ordered at a mountain,
retail's Monarch goes as near as it can and stops, with no pause first).

That change exposed a second bug, this one entirely mine. Path requests are
keyed by UNIT ID, so queueing a second move cancelled the pending request for
the leg in progress and then installed the queued destination's route into that
leg -- the unit set off for the last thing you queued and skipped everything
before it. `order()` now only requests a route when the new order is the one
about to be walked; orders behind it get theirs when they become current.
"the unit walks the FIRST queued leg" is the test that catches it.

### Port plan

1. `PathService` owning a request queue, replacing nothing at first -- run it
   alongside the current mover behind a flag.
2. Per-tick scheduler: count pending requests, `quantum = budget / (A + 5*B)`,
   visit in deterministic order. Budget from match config, default 12000.
3. `PathSearch` as a resumable struct: state, current cell, trace origin and
   direction, best distance, the three cell-quality counters, work counter.
   Costs 8 / 7 / 9 / 30 exactly as above.
4. Cell scoring reuses our existing per-class `NavGrid` + `bodyPenetration`
   occupancy, mapped onto retail's grades: impassable / 4 occupied / 6 ground
   / 7 road, threshold 4.
5. Navigator side: extend orders to carry up to 64 waypoints with pop-on-
   arrival, and install the straight two-point segment while a request is
   outstanding -- which is exactly today's behaviour, so this is the fallback
   path we already have.
6. Retire `pathBudget_` and the inline A* once 1-5 are in and the Monarch
   harness passes.

Determinism gates at every step: `tools/check-determinism.sh` plus the `--mpai`
hash must be reproducible, and the state hash only changes when intended.

### Earlier unresolved note, kept for the record

By direct-call graph, that whole route cluster is reachable only from
`0x4261f0` -- which references the strings `"%s\screenshots"` and `"BIGSHOT"`
and is the poster/screenshot handler -- and from `0x527360`, which has no
callers and no pointers to it anywhere in the image. Function sizes along the
chain are all 74..795 instructions, so this is not an artifact of merged
boundaries, and the `0x4261f0 -> 0x526740` edge was confirmed by hand.

A route generator wired only to the screenshot path is not a credible reading.
The likely gap is that the graph follows direct `call 0xADDR` only and misses
an indirect/vtable invocation from the order system. Until that path is found,
HOW GAMEPLAY INVOKES THE ROUTE PRODUCER IS UNKNOWN, and with it the answer to
what retail does when a body is parked in a unit's way.

Three conclusions about this area have now been published and two retracted in
a single day. The next claim here should come with a demonstrated call path
from the order or unit tick, not from a routine's shape or from a partial graph.

## Retail stores no float in its unit state (2026-09-16)

Asked while porting our own positions to fixed point: which of our remaining
float fields are float in retail? Answer: none of them are.

Across the mover/unit region (0x4da000-0x4dffff) the FPU is used 275 times
against 3556 integer ops, and the split of what it touches is decisive:

    fildl  (load INTEGER, convert)   68
    flds   (load float)              13
    fldl   (load double)              7
    fstps  (store float)              6
    fistp  (store integer)            0

Every one of the 6 float stores, and all but one of the float loads, is
`%ebp`-relative -- stack locals and parameters, not struct fields. The single
exception is `flds 0x5f2830`, a global constant. So retail's persistent unit
state is integer throughout; the FPU is scratch for intermediate arithmetic and
never writes a float back into a unit.

Two fields confirmed directly rather than inferred:

  * **Speed** is fixed-point. The occupancy test compares two units' speeds with
    an integer `cmp`/`jl` (0x4db79e), and the scaling either side calls
    `0x5d3dc0`, which is a 64-bit arithmetic shift invoked with `cl = 0x10` --
    a 16.16 multiply.
  * **Position** is 0x100000 per 16px cell, which is 65536 per pixel. The same
    16.16, so our Fixed matches retail's resolution exactly rather than by
    coincidence.

## Retail-faithful body collision: sub-cell solidity (2026-09-12)

First attempt reverted, then landed once the real obstacle was named. Kept in
full because the obstacle is the interesting part.

Retail's configuration is three things that only work together:
  1. PARKED bodies impassable, MOVING bodies merely expensive (graded score).
  2. The step test scores the body's whole footprint RECT, not one cell.
  3. No separation pass at all -- bodies share space briefly and nothing shoves.

Ours currently has hard-blocking movers and a full-footprint separation push.
Implementing (1) and (2) is straightforward and passes every test: an
`areaScore()` returning -1 impassable / 4 passable / 6 ground / 7 road,
thresholded at 4, with occupancy stamping only parked bodies.

(3) is where it stops. Demoting separation to de-overlap lets a walker
interpenetrate a parked body -- measured closest approach 13px where the
footprints should touch at 32px. The cause is in our mover: it skips the step
test entirely while a unit stays INSIDE ITS OWN CELL, so sub-cell motion is
unchecked and a unit can creep into a neighbour between cell transitions. The
full-radius separation push was silently providing that containment.

So the blocker for retail-faithful collision is SUB-CELL collision handling,
not the score. Retail does not need separation because its refusal happens on
the rect at whatever resolution the mover steps at; ours only happens on cell
entry. Until the mover tests every step rather than every cell crossing,
removing separation trades visible shoving for units sinking into each other.

### What landed

Sub-cell step testing first, as that order implied.

`World::bodyPenetration(u, nx, nz)` asks the same question in PIXEL space that
`cellFree()` answered in 16px cells: how deep would this body sit inside another
if it stood at (nx,nz)? It reads candidates out of `occ_` -- any body we could
overlap has a stamped cell within our own half-extent, so the scan is a small
fixed rect, and a footprint stamps a run of identical ids that dedupes away.
The mover's `free()` is now `bodyPenetration(...) <= 0`, and the "unit stays
inside its own cell, skip the test" hatch is gone.

Two rules make that usable rather than a freeze:

  * Only PARKED bodies are consulted. A moving one is merely expensive, which
    is retail's graded score. Gate on movers too and any crowd wider than its
    lane deadlocks -- measured 16 of 24 arriving where 24 of 24 should.
  * A body you are ALREADY inside is skipped. Units spawn in tight ranks, a
    building finishes under its builder; phrase the rule on the deepest overlap
    and nobody can satisfy it, so nobody moves, and each frozen (speed 0) body
    then blocks its neighbours in turn. De-overlapping stays separation's job.
    The mover's job is the narrow one: never ENTER a body you are clear of.

`rebuildOccupancy` also stamps in two passes, movers first, so a PARKED body
wins a contested cell. A cell holds one id; let a mover overwrite a parked
stamp and the parked body goes invisible to the test that exists to respect it.

Measured: a walker sent straight through a parked body closes to exactly 32px,
its footprint touching and never overlapping. With the cell hatch restored it
reaches 6px in. That ablation is the evidence the hatch was the whole defect.

### The occupancy predicate, and why retail needs no separation pass

Read off `0x4db640` -- the unit half of the passability query -- at
`0x4db767..0x4db7c9`. For each unit found in the target rect it decides whether
that unit blocks. An occupant is IGNORED, letting the step pass straight
through, only when ALL THREE hold:

  1. it is genuinely under way -- retail dereferences a movement object at its
     `+8` and bails to "blocked" (`0x4db8d4`) when there is none;
  2. it is not slower than us -- `[[+8]+0x20]` compared against a computed floor
     AND against our own `[[+8]+0x20]`;
  3. its heading (`+0x7e`) is within `0x4000` of ours, i.e. 90 degrees.

Anything else falls through to `0x4db893`, which returns 2. The threshold at
every call site is 4, so that is a refusal. The return set is: 0 and 2 blocked,
4 blocked, and the terrain score (6 ground / 7 road) when no occupant objected.

In English: **you may close up behind someone going your way who is not slower
than you.** Head-on traffic blocks. Slower traffic ahead of you blocks. Parked
blocks.

That single rule is why retail ships no separation pass and no "don't come to
rest inside another body" check. Overlap barely forms, and the one case that
does create it -- tucking in behind a faster leader -- unwinds itself as the
leader pulls away. Ours now implements the predicate and the separation pass is
DELETED. Two systems enforcing spacing at different resolutions, which is what
we had, is what read in play as units shoving each other around.

Known and accepted: a follower can still end up overlapping its leader if that
leader stops, and nothing now pushes them apart. Retail behaves the same way.
Do not reintroduce a push to "fix" it.

## Self-destruct: the unit quits, it does not explode (2026-09-12)

Ctrl+Shift+D in retail does not kill a unit the way a weapon does. It leaves
your command and fades, with no explosion and no wreck.

The mission is `SelfDestruct` / `UNITMISSIONCODE_SELFDESTRUCT`, whose handler is
at `0x4017e0` -- found through the command table at `0x5eb650`, which pairs
those two name strings with it. What it does:

  * On the first run it seeds a countdown at mission `+0x52` from the unit
    TYPE's `selfdestructcountdown`, tagged `0xF0000000` so a zero count is still
    distinguishable from "not started". Retail packs that key into three bits of
    `UnitType+0x264` (`0x4c09e8` masks it `& 7` and shifts it 21), so its whole
    range is 0..7.
  * Each run decrements and reschedules itself 30 ticks out (`0x4d6a10` sets
    `+0xa = now + arg`), so the countdown steps once a second.
  * At zero it flags `+0x4e` and reschedules a random 0..14 ticks later; that
    next run applies **30000 damage of TYPE 5** to the unit itself, via the
    damage entry at `0x51a140`.

Type 5 is the interesting part. It is not 3, and 3 is the explosion type -- the
one that makes the death handler refuse a corpse and blow every piece apart. And
in that handler type 5 takes its OWN branch (`0x5126a9`), setting a flag in the
death event that no other damage type sets. Nothing in the shipped data gives
any weapon damage type 5; it is the engine's way of marking "this unit quit"
rather than "this unit was killed".

**`selfdestructcountdown` is never set in the shipped data** -- not one of the
558 FBIs across every archive declares it. Which makes the DEFAULT the only
value that matters, and the default is not zero: when the key is absent the
parser clears bit 23 and sets bit 22 of the three-bit field (`0x4c0a1f`),
leaving **2**. Every unit in the game therefore has a two-second countdown.

Running the mission settles it rather than arguing from the disassembly
(`tools/re/emuself.py`, hooking the reschedule, damage and rand calls):

    selfdestructcountdown = 0
      run 0 -> ret=5   expired=0   ('damage', 30000, 5)

    selfdestructcountdown = 2
      run 0 -> ret=1   1 left      ('reschedule', 30)
      run 1 -> ret=1   0 left      ('reschedule', 30)
      run 2 -> ret=1   expired=1   ('reschedule', 0)
      run 3 -> ret=5               ('damage', 30000, 5)

Two reschedules of 30 ticks, then the damage: two seconds, which is what the
game gives you. At 0 it fires on the spot, so the default is doing real work.

Retail also LABELS it, and the label is the whole explanation. The command table
entry carries two strings, `SelfDestruct` and `UNITMISSIONCODE_SELFDESTRUCT`,
and the second is a key into `translate/unitmissions.tdf` -- the table of what a
unit is currently doing, the text the InfoPanel shows:

    [UNITMISSIONCODE_SELFDESTRUCT]
        English = Leaving Your Command;
        German  = Einheit wird Aufgel"ost;
        French  = Abandonne votre camp.;

So the unit's status while the countdown runs is "Leaving Your Command". It is
not a chat line or a notification -- it is the mission label, sitting where
"Moving" or "Guarding" would. (I first put it in the chat overlay, which was
wrong.)

That table also corrects several of our other labels, which were plausible
paraphrases of missions retail names differently:

    RECLAIM      -> "Clearing"          (we said RECLAIMING)
    RECLAIMAREA  -> "Clearing Area"
    LOAD         -> "Loading"           (we said BOARDING)
    BEINGBUILT   -> "Intangible Mass"   (we said UNDER CONSTRUCTION)
    CLOAK        -> "Cloaking"          (we said CLOAKED)
    SEEKATTACK   -> "Seeking to attack" (we said ADVANCING)

## Retail does not sort 3DO primitives -- it z-buffers them (2026-09-12)

The open question from the projection work, settled: there is no primitive sort
to copy, because retail resolves visibility per pixel.

  * The binary imports the Glide depth API outright -- `_grDepthBufferMode@4`,
    `_grDepthBufferFunction@4`, `_grDepthMask@4`, `_grDepthRange@8`,
    `_grDepthBiasLevel@4`, `_grLfbConstantDepth@4`, alongside `_grBufferClear@12`
    and `_grRenderBuffer@4`. That is a hardware depth buffer, configured and
    written, in the 3dfx path (the install ships glide2x/glide3x and a
    ChooseRenderer.exe to pick it).
  * The DirectDraw path wants one too: the error text
    "...because there is no hardware support for zbuffer blting. (NOZBUFFERHW)"
    is a capability complaint about z-buffered blitting, not about sorting.

Following the draw path corroborates it. `0x4eea20` is the piece-tree walk --
it recurses over child/sibling, applies the 3x3 piece rotation to each vertex,
and hands the result on. There is no depth comparison, no insertion into an
ordered list, no swap loop anywhere in it.

**So our triangle sort is not an approximation of retail's sort -- it is an
approximation of retail's Z-BUFFER**, and no choice of sort weights can match it
exactly, because a single key per triangle cannot express what a per-pixel test
does for interpenetrating geometry.

That reframes `kSortZ`/`kSortY`: they are our own stand-in for a depth buffer,
not a retail constant. But a stand-in can still be WRONG, and ours was.

The sort key has to be depth along the view ray, and the projection hands that
over directly: `screenY = z - y/2` means points differing by `(y,z) = (2,1)`
land on the same pixel, so that direction is the ray and depth along it is
proportional to `2y + z`. Larger y is higher and nearer the camera; larger z is
further down-screen and also nearer -- so both terms carry the SAME sign.

The old weights were `cos`/`sin` of the 0.72 rad tilt, which gave y and z
OPPOSITE signs. Every triangle pair separated mainly in z was ordered
backwards, which is what tore layered pieces like a Monarch's cape. Now
`-(2y + z)`, derived rather than fitted.

A correct key was still not enough, because we were not CULLING. Retail does --
it imports `_grCullMode@4` -- and without it both faces of a two-sided piece are
drawn at almost the same depth, so which one wins is arbitrary: a Monarch's cape
came out as a patchwork of its own front and back. The cape is four segments,
each carrying a front quad and a back quad (`capelogoA1`/`A2` and friends), which
is exactly the shape that fails.

The cull is tested against the VIEW DIRECTION, not a screen-space winding sign,
because the transform negates y and may mirror x and reasoning about the
resulting handedness is how sign errors get in. Two measurements settle the
direction without guessing:

  * 3DO polygons are wound so `(v1-v0) x (v2-v0)` points OUTWARD -- 88-97% of
    primitives agree, across araking, arasword, tarnecro and zonhurt.
  * With the cull as written, kept faces sit toward the camera and culled faces
    away: mean offset along the view ray `+2.0..+2.9` for kept against
    `-1.8..-3.4` for culled, at every facing. An inverted sign would swap those.

56-65% of triangles survive, a little over half because flat pieces favour one
side.

What remains beyond this is two triangles that genuinely interpenetrate, which
one key per triangle cannot resolve. That is the real depth-buffer case, and it
means taking models off `SDL_RenderGeometry` -- worth doing only if artifacts
survive a correct key and a cull.

## Unit shadows are PROJECTED SILHOUETTES -- and the Glide path is the one that matters (2026-09-12)

Reported: units have no shadows, then retail screenshots of an Aramon and a
Taros Monarch on open sand, both plainly casting one, the Aramon shadow carrying
the sword as a long thin streak. A blob cannot do that; a projection can.

**The renderer we target is Glide, not the software one.** The icd ships both,
and they shadow units by completely different means. Chasing the software path
first cost a full pass of wrong conclusions, so start here: `Glide3x.dll` is
resolved by name at runtime (hence nothing in the import table), 83 entry points
from a string block at `0x621fe0` into a driver object -- `grDrawTriangle` at
`+0xbc`, `grCullMode` at `+0x120`, and so on, resolved by the stride of stores
at `0x5b8617`.

The giveaway that shadows are GEOMETRY, not sprites, is the renderer's own
counter: `"Max polys rendered : %d ( %d shadow )"`. The shadow tally is the
global `0x62a800`, incremented at `0x4edc67`, inside a rasteriser reached only
from the model draw:

    0x4ee700  draw unit
      0x4ee620   build the piece rotation, walk the piece tree (0x4eea20) ONCE
      0x4ec720 -> 0x4ec7b0 -> 0x4ede50 -> 0x4eda80   the shadow polys

`0x4ede50` projects the same geometry through `0x4ec250` and hands it to the
rasteriser. That routine is the whole answer. It works in 16.16 fixed point and
takes a flag choosing between two shears:

    ecx = -z,  edx = y,  esi = x                     (each >>16, sign-extended)
    flag 0:  edx = y>>1;  ecx -= edx             ->  ( x,        -z - y/2 )
    flag 1:  edx = y>>2;  esi += edx; ecx -= edx ->  ( x + y/4,  -z - y/4 )

`0x4ecf21` passes 0 for the model; `0x4ede50` passes 1 for the shadow. So:

  * Flag 0 independently re-derives our model projection and `kProjY = 0.5`.
  * **The light constants are both a quarter**: `kShadowLX = kShadowLZ = 0.25`.
    We shipped `0.55 / 0.35` first, fitted by eye to a screenshot; they were
    wrong and are now read out of the binary.
  * The shadow is NOT flattened to y=0. It is a second shear of the same
    vertices, so a vertex sits exactly `(+y/4, +y/4)` from its own body vertex
    in screen space -- down and to the right. A flyer at altitude A therefore
    casts its silhouette A/4 right of and A/4 below its body, which is the
    offset shadow every TA-engine flyer has.

The exclusions are only two, both bits of `UnitDef+0x260`: `noshadow`
(`0x2000000`, tested at `0x4ec8d8`) and `floater` (`0x80000`, at `0x4ecac6`).
There is no `canfly` test and no building test, so flyers and keeps both cast.

`ShadowScale` (a 0..3 setting at settings+0x19) maps to 1/2/4 at `0x4ecb83` and
becomes the divisor `0x4ec250` applies to the projected coordinates -- a shadow
resolution knob. `DrawShadows` is the bool at settings+0xf, reaching the draw as
`gameState+0x19c70`.

### The sprite shadows are the SOFTWARE renderer's answer

`0x4c12b0` parses `shadowgaf` and `shadowart` and sets the type's shadow
sequence at `+0x288` only when BOTH keys are present. There is no fallback: the
4th argument of the key reader `0x5432c0` is a default string, but the default
for `shadowart` is empty AND that path returns 0 (`0x543319`), so a missing key
skips the store either way. `shadows.gaf` holds 17 sequences of 6-12 frames --
pre-rendered directional blobs, one frame per facing.

That art is blitted by `0x4ee310`, which is reached only from `0x511d00` and
never from the model draw. **In Glide it is dead for units.** 104 of 203 unit
FBIs declare a `shadowart` and none of them use it; `araking` declares only
`shadowgaf = shadows` and no `shadowart`, which is exactly why the sprite path
could never explain the Monarch.

This also overturns an earlier, well-evidenced but software-only conclusion: we
excluded `canfly` from casting because `0x4ee340` installs shadow art only when
noshadow and canfly are both clear. True of the sprite; false of the renderer we
target. The 24 flying types carrying a `shadowgaf` are not dead data.

Two wrong answers on the way, both worth naming:

  * A fixed 14x5 blob, our own invention, the same size for every unit and at
    alpha 70 effectively invisible.
  * The model's GROUND PLATE -- the flat untextured unit-sized quad every root
    carries (`AraGP`, +-17.6 for a Monarch, +-14.4 for a swordsman). It looks
    like the answer, and it is not: a rectangle cannot be a silhouette, and
    `arasword` carries the same plate while using a sprite. It is a footprint
    marker.

### It is a flat multiply, not per-triangle alpha

Retail's shadow is one uniform tone with no internal structure -- no darkening
where a wing crosses a body. Sampling a retail screenshot gives shadowed/unshadowed
ratios of 124/225, 106/192, 92/170: a flat multiply to **0.55**, equal on all
three channels, so it multiplies the ground rather than blending toward a grey.

That is what the rasteriser's `alloca` at `0x4eda83` is for -- 0x5f08 bytes of
span/coverage buffer. The whole silhouette is rasterised into it and blended
ONCE. Drawing the triangles individually with alpha instead stacks them wherever
the silhouette folds over itself, which reads as obviously wrong next to retail.

We reproduce it with a coverage mask: clear the batch's bounding box to white,
draw every shadow triangle opaque at 0.55 grey with blending off, then composite
that rect once with `SDL_BLENDMODE_MOD`. Bounding box, not full screen -- a
7680x2160 clear and blit twice a frame is most of the cost and none of the gain.

### Probe the shear sign on a GROUND unit, never on a flyer

Retail's shadow is `(+y/4, +y/4)` from the body in screen space: down AND right.
In our renderer that is `rx + kShadowLX*w[1]` and `rz + kShadowLZ*w[1]` -- plus
on both.

The trap, which cost a wrong commit: a flyer's shadow carries TWO x terms, the
per-vertex shear and the altitude offset applied at the anchor, and the altitude
term can outweigh the vertex one. Probing the sign on flyers (set `kShadowLX` to
2.0 and see which way the silhouettes smear) therefore reports the sign of the
wrong term -- it said "negate x", and negating x sent every GROUND unit's shadow
leaning left, which is what the player then saw.

A ground unit has `alt = 0`, so it isolates the vertex expression exactly. Probe
there. The exaggerated constant is still the right technique: with `+` a ground
unit smears hard right, with `-` hard left, unambiguous in one screenshot.

Shadow triangles skip the backface cull -- a silhouette is the union of both
faces, and culling half of it punches holes. Anchor the shadow on the BODY
anchor plus retail's delta, never on a re-derived ground point: flyers are
exempt from our terrain lift, so a ground-derived anchor picks up a lift the
body never had and the horizontal lean cancels to nothing.

Cost: every casting unit walks its model a second time.

## The projection is a SHEAR, not a tilt (2026-09-12)

`0x421dad` spells retail's world-to-screen transform out in seven instructions:

    movswl 0x2(%esi),%ecx     ; x
    sub    cameraX,%ecx       ; screenX = x - cameraX
    movswl 0xa(%esi),%eax     ; z
    movswl 0x6(%esi),%edx     ; y
    sar    $1,%edx            ; y / 2
    sub    %edx,%eax          ; z - y/2
    sub    cameraY,%eax       ; screenY = z - y/2 - cameraY

So screen Y takes ALL of z and HALF of y, and screen X takes no y at all.

The important part is what that is NOT: 1.0 and 0.5 are not the cosine and sine
of any angle, so the transform cannot be written as a tilt. We had modelled it
as one for a long time -- `cos(gTilt)=0.75`, `sin(gTilt)=0.66` -- which is wrong
in both terms at once, and wrong in a way no amount of tuning the angle could
fix. `kProjY = 0.5` and `kProjZ = 1.0` replace it.

This is the same halving as the terrain lift, which is the point: one projection
governs models, the terrain relief, flyer altitude, the selection ring's mid
height, and the hit box (derived from the same `collect()` walk, so it follows
for free and stays consistent with what is drawn).

`gTilt` is gone entirely, along with the `--tilt` flag that tuned it: there is
no camera angle here to tune. What remains is a triangle depth-sort key inside a
model (`kSortZ`/`kSortY`, the old cos/sin values kept as plain weights), needed
only because we draw without a depth buffer. What retail's software renderer
sorts 3DO primitives by has NOT been established -- that is the open question
here, and the constants say so.

## The terrain-height lift is height/2 (2026-09-12)

Units are drawn lifted up-screen to sit on relief that is painted into flat
tiles. We had been lifting `1.1` px per height unit, picked by eye. Retail's
figure is **0.5**, and the arithmetic is explicit:

  * `0x511140(point)` reads the point's cell through `0x50e600` and returns byte
    `+4` of the 14-byte cell record -- the terrain height.
  * Its caller `0x426820` forms
        `screenY = (z << 4) - cameraY - (height >> 1)`
        `screenX = (x << 4) - cameraX`
    so the lift is height/2 in Y, and there is NO height term in X.

`tools/re/emulift.py` drives both with a stubbed cell lookup to confirm which
byte comes back, since that was the load-bearing assumption. At height 120 that
is 60px of lift against the 132px we were applying -- a unit on raised ground
sat most of four tiles too far up-screen, which is why it looked like it was
standing on terrain beside it rather than on its own.

Our `kHeightScaleX_` was already 0, which the same instruction sequence
confirms is right.

Two other details fall out of the same neighbourhood. `0x511170` is the
BILINEAR sampler: it takes a sub-cell position (`sar $4` for the cell, `and
$0xf` for the fraction), reads four neighbouring cells and interpolates -- so
retail smooths the lift across a slope exactly as our `heightAbove` does. And
the cell record really is 14 bytes with the height at `+4`, which the same code
shows twice over (`+0x4` and `+0x12` are the same field one cell apart).

## Retail never lets a unit stand behind terrain (2026-09-12)

A tall cell's painted face leans up-screen over the lower ground to its north,
so a unit stopping there is drawn inside the rock. Retail does not fix that at
draw time by painting the face back over the unit -- it keeps units OUT of those
cells. The occlusion block is a movement rule, not a rendering one.

This engine had that pass, and I deleted it earlier the same day for blocking
12% of Inner Circle and stranding an army (2 of 24 arriving). It was right all
along; the PROJECTION CONSTANT inside it was wrong. It leaned the face north by
1.1 px per height unit, where retail's figure is 0.5 -- proven separately off
`0x511140` and `0x426820`. At more than twice the real lean it condemned more
than twice the ground:

    Inner Circle     at 1.1: 4554 cells (12.4%)   at 0.5: 2294 (6.2%)
    Two Castles      at 1.1: 7238 ( 4.9%)         at 0.5: 4325 (2.9%)
    Angvir's Maze    at 1.1: 4458 ( 4.4%)         at 0.5: 2047 (2.0%)

Restored at 0.5 and writing into the SHARED overlay -- the per-class grids are
what `navFor()` actually hands a unit, and the legacy grids are not -- the army
test passes 24 of 24, and routing is unchanged at 97/78/31% for 40/80/160-cell
goals.

Two lessons in one bug. A constant that is merely "a bit off" can look like a
design being wrong: I concluded the whole pass was misconceived when it was one
number. And a rendering constant turned out to belong to the movement rules,
which is why it mattered twice over.

## Dynamic analysis: emulating icd routines (2026-09-12)

Static reading gets a routine's shape; it does not tell you whether YOUR port
behaves like it. Emulating the original function and diffing the two does.

The harness (kept outside the repo, in the session scratch dir) is about 90
lines of Python on Unicorn: map the PE's `.text`, `.rdata` and `.data` at their
virtual addresses, give it a stack and a heap, then call a function with the
stdcall / `__thiscall` conventions the binary uses. Sub-calls that need the live
game -- the cell query, the allocator -- are hooked and answered from a
synthetic grid, so a routine can be driven over test data the real game could
never produce on demand.

It observes; it copies nothing. CLAUDE.md is updated accordingly: the binary is
for reverse-engineering, static and dynamic, and never for lifting code or data
into the engine.

First result, checking `pathDirFromDelta` against `0x415040` over 81 deltas:
80 agree, and the single disagreement is the degenerate zero delta, where the
icd answers 5 and we answered 0. The search should never ask for a direction to
where it already stands, so it changes no behaviour -- but it took one run to
find something no amount of re-reading the disassembly had.

The harness lives in `tools/re/` (`emu.py` loads the image and calls into it;
`emusearch.py` drives the path search over a synthetic grid).

### What it found in the search, immediately

Driving `0x4146e0` over a 24x12 grid with a wall across the path and one gap,
hooking the cell query to answer from that grid, and logging every probe:

    c(2,6)...c(7,6)   cardinal march east, blocked by the wall at x=8
    A(7,5) B(8,7)     the cursors split; B steps diagonally into the gap row
    A(7,4) B(9,6)     B is through and back on the goal line
    c(10,6)...c(20,6) march resumes to the goal

27 cell visits for the whole thing. The probe log then gave the exact rule:

    A: probes 6 -> 7 -> 0  ACCEPT      (starts at the BLOCKED dir, rotates up)
    B: probes 6 -> 5      ACCEPT       (starts at the BLOCKED dir, rotates down)
    A next, dir=0: probes 6 -> 7 -> 0  (starts at dir-2, rotates up)
    B next, dir=5: probes 7            (starts at dir+2, rotates down)

So each cursor's FIRST probe begins on the direction that was just refused, and
only afterwards does the +-2 offset apply. Our port seeded both cursors with the
blocked direction, so their first probes opened at blocked+-2 and skipped
straight past it -- turning a two-step detour into a long wander. Seeding
`dirA = blocked-2` and `dirB = blocked+2` makes the offsets land on the blocked
direction and fixes it.

Measured before and after on Inner Circle, unit travelling toward a goal N cells
away, as a percentage of the distance closed:

    goal      +20    +40    +80   +160
    before    70%    97%    19%     9%
    after     95%    97%    78%    31%

and searches that used to abandon at the visit limit (20, 60, 80, 120, 160 cells)
now all arrive. Hours of re-reading the disassembly had not found this; the
emulator found it in one run, because it could show what the original DOES
rather than what it looks like it should do.

### The cost of it working, and the budget

At retail's own budget of 12000 work units a tick, the 8-AI benchmark costs
42.2ms/tick at ~2040 units against a ~19.5ms baseline -- over the 33ms a 30Hz
tick has.

I first put that down to units which used to wedge now marching, and reasoned
that budget-capped searches could not account for 20ms. That was wrong, and one
run settled it: at a budget of 1500 the same benchmark costs 23.5ms at ~2010
units. The searches ARE the cost. A work unit is not a cell query -- a trace
step charges 9 and can probe up to seven directions -- so query count runs well
ahead of the budget.

**Routing does not suffer for it.** Measured at 12000, 3000 and 1500 on Inner
Circle, the percentage of the distance closed is identical for 40-, 80- and
160-cell goals. The budget decides how FAST a search finishes, not whether it
can: the unit walks its straight segment meanwhile and the route lands a few
ticks later either way.

So `setupMatch` runs at 1500. That is 12.5% of retail's default and sits well
inside the 5%..1000% band retail's own quality setting covers (`0x4252e0`), so
it is a supported configuration rather than a deviation.

Two micro-fixes are also in, neither of which moved the number much: the
per-cell scratch is generation-stamped instead of cleared (it was zeroing ~110KB
per request), and the retry sweep does its cheap tests before the O(orders)
`currentLeg` scan.

## Unit animation: the engine drives very little of it (2026-09-12)

Audited against the Glide renderer and the 204 shipped COBs. The headline is
that retail's engine does NOT call the animations. It calls a small set of entry
points, and the SCRIPT runs its own state machines from there.

**How to enumerate the entry points.** `0x56c640` / `0x56c5c0` / `0x56c720` /
`0x56c4a0` / `0x56c680` are call-script-by-name; scanning .text for a
`push <string constant>` feeding any of them gives the authoritative list:

    Create  Killed  Dying  HitByWeapon  Activate  Deactivate
    StartBuilding  StopBuilding  StartCloaking  StopCloaking
    AimWeapon  FireWeapon  TargetCleared  SetMaxReloadTime  MoveRate
    TurnDirection  WindChange  setSFXoccupy  BeginFlight  BeginLanding
    QueryWeapon  QueryBlood  QueryBuildInfo  QueryNanoPiece  QueryLandingPad
    AimFrom  SweetSpot

Note what is NOT there: `walk`, `attack1`, `death`, `startbuild`, `OpenYard`,
`Go`, `Stop`. The strings "OpenYard", "CloseYard" and "Go" do not occur in the
binary at all. Those are called BY THE SCRIPT. `Create` ends by starting the
control threads (araarch: `START_SCRIPT 8/9/10` = MoveWatcher, MeleeControl,
StatusControl), which poll unit values and pick the animation themselves --
MeleeControl is the movement dispatcher, choosing walk_legs / walk_water /
walk_road / walk from unit values 28 and 34.

So a unit animates correctly only if `GET_UNIT_VALUE` answers correctly. That
is the real contract, not the list of scripts we remember to call.

**The getter table** is at `0x50d394`, dispatched at `0x50ceb0` as
`index = id - 1`, valid 1..46, anything else returning 0. Ids the shipped
scripts actually ask for, by use count:

    17 (282)  29 (142)  28 (122)  32 (106)  34 (94)  4 (85)
    18 (30)   33 (9)    27 (9)    46 (2)    30 (1)

We answer 17, 29, 28, 32, 34, 4, 27 (plus 1, 6, 9, which nothing asks for).
Still unanswered: 33, 46 (`(unit+0x130 >> 20) & 3`), 30.

### The build yard was hung, and the comment said it was fine

Id 18 is YARD_OPEN, used only by OpenYard/CloseYard -- the castle/factory build
doors. It is a BLOCKING handshake (aracastl OpenYard):

    SET 18,1                      request the yard
  loop:
    GET 18; NOT; JUMP_IF_FALSE done     leave only on NONZERO
    SET 19,1                      BUGGER_OFF: shove units out of the yard
    SLEEP 1500; SET 18,1; JUMP loop

We answered 0, with a comment claiming that was "benign/correct ... yard treated
clear". It is the opposite: 0 means REFUSED, so the script retries every 1.5s
for ever. And `Go` CALLs startbuild (the doors) and then OpenYard, so that
thread never returns and the state machine never reaches Stop/stopbuild -- the
doors open and never close.

Measured on the real COBs with our own VM (`tools/cobyard_test.cpp`): answering
0 issues BUGGER_OFF 25-27 times in 40 simulated seconds and rises for ever;
answering 1 issues it 0 times. We now grant it unconditionally, since our sim
has no notion of a unit blocking a yard and we never act on BUGGER_OFF anyway.

Two false starts worth recording, because both are easy to repeat: thread counts
do NOT work as the test observable. A factory legitimately keeps a thread open
while active (Creon's `Go` ends with `START_SCRIPT FactoryFun`, the machinery
loop), and the deactivate path has a handshake of its own -- so "a thread is
still running" flags healthy units. Counting BUGGER_OFF reads the protocol
itself and is faction-independent.

### Known remaining gaps

  * `MeleeAttack` was in our fire-animation fallback chain and is defined by
    ZERO of the 204 COBs -- it could only ever fail. Removed. The melee
    animation comes from MeleeControl, which Create starts.
  * "We call walk/attack1/startbuild DIRECTLY where retail lets the scripts
    choose" -- OVERSTATED, corrected below. For `walk` it is false outright.
  * `QueryNanoPiece` -- RETRACTED, see below. I claimed our sparkle "does not
    originate where retail's does". It does. Chased it down and the opposite is
    true.
  * Unit value 30 is still answered with 0, and staying that way deliberately.
    Its handler (`0x50d2e0` -> `0x4dc1f0`) is flyer-only: it bails unless
    UnitDef+0x260 bit 0x800 (canfly) is set, then computes
    `typeField * unit[+0x12b] / 16`, picking the type field (`+0x172` or
    `+0x16e`) off a state bit -- a signed, scaled velocity of some kind. The
    only consumer in the shipped data is ONE script in ONE unit (lifbird's
    FlightControl), which compares it against -50 to pick a third animation
    branch; 0 takes the hover branch, which is the right look for a bird at
    rest. Not worth pinning down the exact quantity for one NPC bird's dive
    pose, but that is the shape of it if it ever matters.

## The build sparkle: QueryNanoPiece is vestigial (2026-09-12)

Retracting a claim I made in the animation audit above: that our build effect
"originates in the wrong place" because retail queries the builder's nano piece
and we do not. Chasing it down, retail queries that piece and THROWS THE ANSWER
AWAY.

The build mission is `0x401c20`. It does:

    lea  eax,[ebp-0x18]
    push eax ; push edi          edi = the BUILDER
    call 0x4dd530                QueryNanoPiece -> piece -> 0x4dd250 -> world xyz
    mov  ecx,[esi+0x16]          esi = the MISSION, +0x16 = the unit being built
    push 0 ; push 1
    mov  ecx,[ecx+0xc0]          ...its drawable
    call 0x4eec20                play the effect ON THE TARGET

`[ebp-0x18]` -- the nano piece's world position -- is written there and never
read again anywhere in the function, and `0x4dd530` has no other caller. So the
position is computed and discarded. This is TA-1997 vestigial: TA drew a
nanolathe BEAM from that piece, TA:Kingdoms does not.

What actually draws is `0x4eec20` -> `0x4f1430`, a rand-driven particle spawner
run against the emitter hanging off the target's drawable (`+0x174`), one
particle per build-mission tick, the mission rescheduling itself as it runs.
`0x4eec20` is generic -- ten mission handlers use it -- so it is "play this
drawable's effect", not a build-specific thing.

So the sparkle belongs on the UNIT BEING BUILT, which is what we do. Building a
builder-to-target beam would have been inventing an effect retail does not have,
which is exactly what the retail-first rule exists to prevent.

One real divergence remains, unverified: we sprinkle the BUILDER as well as the
site (`gameview_render.cpp`, "the worker end"). The build mission emits only on
the target -- the builder appears there solely as the argument to the discarded
nano query. I have not removed ours, because one call site is thin evidence that
no other path lights the builder up.

## Following up the animation audit: two of my own claims were wrong (2026-09-12)

**Unit value 33 is the signed TURN RATE, in 16-bit angle units.**
SuperDynamicWheelSpinner (9 wheeled units) reads it, tests it against +910 and
-910, and uses the sign to spin the two sides of the vehicle at different rates
-- the differential of a vehicle in a turn. 910 is what fixes the scale: it is
5 degrees in 16-bit angle units (65536/360*5 = 910.2). We now answer it from the
snapshot's heading against its previous-tick heading. Verified by running
aracan's real script: 2 distinct wheel rates going straight, 4 when turning.

**Unit value 46 is "have I got a target".** Only HolsterControl (verbers,
vercrus) reads it and only ever against 0 -- zero holsters the weapon, non-zero
draws it. Retail's is `(unit+0x130 >> 20) & 3`; nothing reads the other bits.

**The builder does not sparkle.** Removed. Retail's build mission plays the
effect on the unit being BUILT and on nothing else; the builder's contribution
is its StartBuilding animation. See the nano-piece section above.

**RETRACTION: "we drive walk directly instead of letting the scripts choose".**
This is false for every shipped unit. Our mover branch already hands off to the
script's own threads when the COB has MoveWatcher / MeleeControl / DemonControl,
and the number of shipped units that have a `walk` cycle but none of those three
is ZERO. The direct-walk fallback is dead code against this data set. I wrote
the claim from the call sites without checking which units could reach them.

The rest of that claim is narrower than I made it sound:

  * `attack1` / `fire` are FALLBACKS after `FireWeapon`, which is a real engine
    entry point, and exactly one shipped unit (targarg) has attack1 without
    FireWeapon.
  * `startbuild` is called directly rather than through retail's
    Activate -> RequestState -> Go chain. Visually equivalent: Go's contribution
    is CALL startbuild (the doors, which we run) plus CALL OpenYard, and
    OpenYard moves no piece -- it is the pathfinding yard handshake, which our
    sim does not model. Deliberate, too: the direct call avoids a VM reset that
    would kill a building's Create ambients (flags, smoke).

The lesson for the next audit: "the engine calls X directly" is a claim about
CALL SITES, and the question that matters is which units can actually reach
them. Check the data before writing it down.

## Headless in-game screenshots (dev harness)

`--shot` alone captures the LOBBY and exits: it forces the dummy video driver and
the menu path shoots before the game starts. To capture a real in-game frame use
the auto-lobby driver plus a delayed capture, all with the DEBUG binary:

```sh
TAK_MPAUTO=4 TAK_SHOT_MS=35000 SDL_VIDEODRIVER=dummy SDL_AUDIODRIVER=dummy \
  ./build-dbg/takclient game "Inner Circle" --data <install> --shot out.png
```

- `TAK_MPAUTO=4` drives the lobby the way `--mpai` does, but through the
  INTERACTIVE (rendering) loop instead of the headless one. Without it the client
  sits at NOT READY forever and the shot is a lobby frame.
- `TAK_SHOT_MS=<ms>` delays the capture by wall-clock ms (default is 3 frames).
- Add `TAK_STRESS=1` to spawn each AI at ~95% of the unit cap for instant mass
  combat -- the quickest way to see projectile art, beams and storms on screen.
- No real window is needed; the dummy driver renders correctly.

## Mana is a double, and the economy is floating point (2026-09-15)

Asked while converting our remaining floats: is mana fixed point in retail, or an
integer? Neither -- it is 64-bit floating point, and this was worth chasing
because two plausible-sounding wrong answers came first.

The evidence is the end-of-game stats screen. At 0x500586 and 0x5005ba the
builder loads two values with `fldl` (a 64-bit load) from +0x18 and +0x20 of the
player's stats object and passes each to the ftol helper at 0x5d3d54 before
storing the result as the displayed integer. The labels resolve through
0x617ca8 / 0x617cac to "Mana Produced" and "Excess Mana". So the STORED
accumulator is a double and the integer is only the rendering.

Two more sites agree:

  * The accumulate is a double read-modify-write: `faddl 0x18(%eax)` followed by
    `fstpl 0x18(%eax)` (0x425d5a, 0x429d45, 0x4cb61c, 0x4ea1cc).
  * The affordability check at 0x46e85f loads an integer cost with `fildl` and
    subtracts the pool with `fsubl 0xd1(%edi)` -- again 64-bit.

Two wrong answers to avoid repeating:

  * "Retail stores no float in its unit state" is true, but it was measured over
    the mover/unit region only and says nothing about the economy. Binary-wide
    there are 718 float stores to non-stack destinations.
  * The player table at +0x2404 (stride 0x110) really is touched by 463 integer
    movs and zero FP instructions -- but its first field is a POINTER, null-checked
    and then dereferenced (0x9b(%ecx), 0xea(%edi)). Counting instructions against
    a pointer table says nothing about the fields it points at. The stats copies
    `total_mana` (+0x2c) and `mana_wasted` (+0x34) ARE integers, which is what
    makes the wrong conclusion easy to reach: they are the snapshot, not the pool.

This also explains the range problem from the porting side. Our Fixed is 16.16
in an int32 and saturates at 32768; mana routinely runs far past that. Retail did
not use fixed point here either, so matching it is not a compromise.

## Timers are integer ticks, and how to tell a field's type (2026-09-15)

Asked while converting the last of our sim floats: for each remaining field, is
it a float, 16.16 fixed point, or an integer? Reading the load opcode answers
half of it -- `flds`/`fldl` load a float, `fildl` loads an integer -- but what
says which KIND of integer is the scale the engine multiplies by afterwards.
Two constants, both .rdata doubles, decode nearly everything:

    0x5f25d8 = 0.03333... = 1/30       -> a count of 30Hz TICKS
    0x5eba78 = 1.52587890625e-05 = 1/65536 -> 16.16 FIXED POINT

`tools/re/emufields.py` confirms both by emulation rather than by eye: it plants
known values in a synthetic struct and runs the engine's own display sequences
over them. A reload field holding 90 comes out as "3.000000" seconds; a position
field holding 6586368 comes out as 100.5 px.

So the weapon dump at 0x617770 ("Damage = %i, Reload Time = %f, ManaPerShot =
%f") reads its reload from +0x9c as a 16-BIT INTEGER (`mov 0x9c(%esi),%cx`) and
scales it by 1/30 purely to print it. Retail stores a cooldown as a tick count.
The same shape covers the other countdowns.

Worth noting what this does NOT say. The def also holds genuine floats --
ManaRechargeRate is `readFloat` into +0x1a6 and MaxMana into +0x1a2, both stored
with `fstps` -- so retail's type data mixes all three representations, while
maxdamage at +0x1be is `readInt`. The rule is per field, not per struct.

## Two more field types, and a build accumulator that is 16.16 TICKS (2026-09-16)

Finishing the float sweep, two fields had no settled answer. Both were decided by
running retail's own code (tools/re/emu.py), not by reading it.

**Aura adjustments are genuine floats.** [AdjustArmor]/[AdjustAttack]/[AdjustJoy]
parse at 0x4c1487 into 20-byte sub-objects on the unit def (+0x1c6, +0x1da,
+0x1ee) via 0x5182b0, whose layout is:

    +0x04  Adjustment         readFloat, default 1.0   (fstps -- a float)
    +0x08  Radius             readInt
    +0x0c  EdgeEffectiveness  readFloat
    +0x10  AffectsEnemy       readInt != 0

Emulating the default-init at 0x518320 writes 0x3f800000 to +0x04 -- the IEEE
pattern for 1.0f. A 16.16 one would be 0x00010000. So a live aura multiplier is
a float in retail, which is what ours already were.

**Build progress is 16.16, and it counts TICKS.** At 0x406ce1 the engine computes

    buildtime / (workertime * (1/30)) * 65536

and passes it through the ftol helper to store an INTEGER at +0x52. The 65536 is
the giveaway: this is a fixed-point tick count, not a plain one, so a partial
tick of work survives instead of being truncated away. Emulated to be sure:
buildtime 170 / workertime 1 comes out as 5100 ticks = 170 seconds exactly, and
170/2 gives 2550 = 85s.

That also pins the units, which were ambiguous from our side: `buildtime` is
SECONDS at workertime 1, and workertime divides it.

Nearby, for the record: buildcost (+0x20e), buildtime (+0x212) and workertime
(+0x21a) are all `readFloat` in the def. As with the rest of retail's type data,
the representation is per field -- ints, floats and 16.16 sit side by side in one
struct -- so the only reliable way to read one is to find where it is CONSUMED
and look at the scale it is multiplied by.

## Retail's own data types, field by field (2026-09-16)

Asked which of our types still differ from retail's. The binary has FOUR TDF
readers, not the three named above: `readInt @0x543190`, `readFloat @0x5431c0`,
`readString @0x5432c0`, and `0x5431f0`, which parses into 16.16 FIXED POINT and
stores the raw dword. That last one is how the movement constants are read --
maxvelocity (+0x162), acceleration (+0x16a), brakerate, watermultiplier (+0x16e)
and roadmultiplier (+0x172) -- and the debug dump reads them back with `fildl`
scaled by 1/65536, confirming the format.

Where we still differ:

  * 16.16 in retail, float in ours: maxVel, accel, brake, roadMult, waterMult.
  * INT in retail, float in ours: maxHp (maxdamage), sight (sightdistance),
    radar, turnRate, turnInPlaceRate, buildDist, transportDist, minCloakDist,
    leash (maneuverleashlength), cruiseAlt, maxSlope, maxWaterSlope,
    maxWaterDepth, minWaterDepth; and on Weapon: range, damage, aoe
    (areaofeffect). `damage` is corroborated by the dump's "%i" format.
  * Narrower than retail: Unit::mana is a float where Player::mana is a double
    and the affordability check at 0x46e85f uses `fsubl`.

Already matching: storage/income (mogrium*), buildCost, buildTime, workerTime,
healTime, maxMana, manaRegen, cloakCostMove, projVel (weaponvelocity), reload
(reloadtime), edge (edgeeffectiveness), and the live aura multipliers
(Adjustment, a float defaulting to 1.0 -- see the aura section).

None of this is a determinism hazard: type data is parsed once from identical
bytes on every peer. It is a fidelity gap.

### RESOLVED (2026-09-16): converting only HALF the group is what cost arrivals

An earlier attempt moved the movement constants to 16.16 per-tick and left
turnRate as float rad/s. That cost crowdbench's opposing columns 32/32 -> 23/32,
and a counter on the mover's refusal branch showed why the symptom appeared
where it did: refusals went 56,650 -> 88,518 in opposing columns and
5,571 -> 15,333 at the chokepoint, while uncongested scenarios were untouched.

The cause was the half-conversion itself. `bamFromRadians(turnRate * dt)` is an
identity round trip -- the FBI value is COB angle units, Bam is the same unit,
so scaling to rad/s at load and back per tick returns the input -- but it goes
through float in both directions. With speed per-tick and the turn still doing
that round trip, the two disagreed at the step test.

Converting turnRate to the stored integer removes the round trip, and opposing
columns does not merely recover, it improves sharply: t50 65.6 -> 25.2 with
searches 669 -> 230, all five scenarios at full arrival. The lesson is the
general one for this port: a representation change that is an identity on paper
still has to be carried all the way through, because the intermediate state is
where the two conventions meet.

Both unit bugs found on the way are worth keeping: arcDist divided a per-tick
speed by a per-second turn rate, and the UnitType struct defaults for
accel/brake are px/s^2 values used only by synthetic test types -- replacing
them with the FBI default of 0.5 made them 30x stronger and collapsed stopDist
from ~26px to 0.87px.

## Two tests on how close our movement now is (2026-09-16)

Asked how closely pathfinding matches retail, two things were flagged as ours
rather than retail's. Both were measured rather than argued.

### The route horizon already matches -- we were closer than claimed

Retail's navigator holds at most two or three intermediate points and re-anchors
about every 6 ticks (0x4e5150; the count at +0x10c is tested against 2 and 3).
We install a route, which looked like a divergence. It is not: the string-pull
collapses routes to almost nothing, and a histogram of what actually gets
installed says

    scenario            1 wp   2    3    4    9-16
    opposing columns    100%   -    -    -    -
    open field          100%   -    -    -    -
    group order         100%   -    -    -    -
    chokepoint           81%  19%   -    -    -
    serpentine maze      44%  12%  23%  12%   8%

so outside a synthetic maze essentially every installed "route" is a single
waypoint plus the destination -- retail's shape, reached by a different road.
Truncating the install to a 3-point horizon is a literal no-op: byte-identical
crowdbench output, same search and work counts, because there is nothing to
truncate. Do not "fix" this divergence; it is not one.

### The A* fallback is inert on open ground and load-bearing in a maze

Disabling the escalation entirely (kDetoursBeforeAStar effectively infinite)
leaves four of five crowdbench scenarios BYTE-IDENTICAL -- it never fires there
-- and the harness hash on Inner Circle is unchanged too. The maze is the whole
of its effect:

    serpentine        with A*   without
    t50                  72.8     226.
    travel              x1.89    x6.19
    searches              263      747

All twelve units still arrive without it, so this is path QUALITY, not
correctness. And it is not hypothetical on real maps: instrumented over a 10
minute 8-AI game on Ulasem Arena, the fallback escalated 37 times.

What is NOT established is whether retail escalates at all. Nothing like it has
been found in the binary, but that is absence of evidence: the tracer is a bug
algorithm and would be just as bad in a maze, so "retail is bad here too" is the
likelier reading. The reason it has not simply been deleted is that the measured
cost is a 3x arrival time and a 6.19x path on the one layout that exercises it,
and that trade deserves a decision rather than a default.

## The steering layer: why our units stack and will not go around each other

RE'd 2026-09-16, static analysis only, after a report that units pile up and
drive into obstacles instead of around them. Nothing here is implemented yet --
this section exists so the port has a spec before any sim change lands.

### There are TWO pathfinding subsystems, and we ported one

The boundary tracer at `0x4139d0`-`0x416xxx` is the one this document already
covers and the one `src/sim/pathsearch.*` ports. It routes around TERRAIN and
knows nothing about units.

There is a second, separate cluster -- the mover at `0x4dfd70` and the cell
raters at `0x5086xx`-`0x5094xx` -- that we never ported at all. That is the
unit-aware layer, and its absence is exactly the reported behaviour: bodies
stack because nothing makes a moving unit solid, and routes drive into crowds
because the tracer cannot see units.

### Cells are rated 0..7, and units are part of the rating

`0x509020` returns a passability rating, NOT a cost -- higher is better. The
same structure appears independently at `0x404ff9`, which is how the reading was
confirmed rather than assumed.

    7   default / open ground        (the initial value at 0x50904d)
    6   clamped when a terrain flag is clear   (+0xd bit 0x80, at 0x509348)
    4   clamped by the slope tests             (0x509318 / 0x509322)
    1   cell held by a MOVING unit             (0x50917c)
    0   cell held by a PARKED unit -- blocked  (the xor eax,eax exits)

The occupant is read from the cell record: word at `+8` is the occupant id,
`0xffff` means empty, and `0xfffe` means "this is a tail cell of a multi-cell
body" -- follow the back-pointer built from the bytes at `+0xa`/`+0xb` and the
map stride at `[0x62d55c]+0x19e98`. Byte `+6` is the height used by the slope
test. Units live in a table at `[0x62d55c]+0x19edc` with stride `0x140` and a
count at `+0x19ec0`; the flag word is at unit `+0x13c`, where bit 5 (`0x20`)
means "a unit occupies this cell" and bit 17 (`0x20000`) means "it is moving".
Every exit path reports its rating through `0x509390`.

So a parked body is a wall and a moving body is passable at 1/7 the rating of
open ground. Body-blocking a bridge is a real tactic, and a crowd is something a
route bends around rather than through, without either being special-cased.

### The rating is consumed as a per-unit LOCAL WINDOW, rebuilt every step

`0x509020` has exactly one caller (`0x508fc5`, inside the wrapper `0x508f30`),
found by scanning for `E8 rel32` rather than by linear disassembly -- a naive
linear sweep desyncs on data and reports zero callers, which is what it did at
first and what made this look indirect.

Above that, `0x508e50` rates a cell together with its orthogonal neighbours and
requires `> 4` and `>= 6` of them: a corner-clearance test, so a unit will not
cut a diagonal through the gap between two bodies. `0x508cd0` is the same shape
against a second rater at `0x5088f0`. `0x508e20` initialises the working set --
it clears `0x121` dwords at `0x6405d4` and stores its two parameters at
`0x6405d0`/`0x6405cc`.

The mover at `0x4dfd70` (reached from `0x4c0e22`) is what ties it together: each
step it fills a local buffer at `ebp-0x1ec` with the ratings over the unit's
footprint window, dispatching on footprint size (`<= 5`, `<= 11` at `0x4e0260`)
between a batched fill (`0x508db0`) and a per-cell one (`0x508cd0`), writing
each result through `0x4dfe40`. The hard "may I stand here at all" test is
`0x507d10`, which has nine callers.

This is the piece `src/sim/sim.h` means when it says "there is no local obstacle
avoidance in the steering". Retail rebuilds a small unit-aware cost window per
mover per step and steers on it; we steer straight at the order point.

### What we have, what we lack

We already have more than the old comment implies: the tracer is ported and
`PathService` owns a queue, a bounded pool of concurrent searches and a per-tick
budget. The gap is specifically:

  1. cell ratings that include units (parked 0, moving 1, open 7);
  2. the per-unit local rating window and the corner-clearance test;
  3. solidity for MOVING units -- ours records only stationary ones, and the
     separation relaxation resolves overlap after the fact so it cannot stop
     anyone, which is precisely why they stack.

### NOT established -- do not build on these

`src/sim/sim.h` asserts retail affords hard solidity through "continuous
short-hop replanning, randomised repath delays and an age-weighted per-player
path budget". Those three were NOT confirmed in this pass. They may well be
real -- the claim came from somewhere -- but no routine for any of them has been
identified, and the implementation should not assume them. The consumer of the
rating window (the function containing `0x4c0e22`) also resisted a prologue
scan and has not been read.

Establishing those is the remaining work before the rating port is designed,
because they are what decides whether hard solidity flows or gridlocks.
