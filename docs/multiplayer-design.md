# Multiplayer Design: Client–Server, 8 Players, Teams

How TAK Engine's multiplayer works: one server (`takserver`) relays every game, every
peer runs the same deterministic simulation, and only commands cross the wire
(`src/net/lockstep.h` holds the command format). The protocol version is
`kNetVersion` = 323 (`src/net/protocol.h`).

Single player runs the same way: the client starts a private local `takserver`
(`--local --no-auth`) and plays through it ([sp-mp-equivalence.md](sp-mp-equivalence.md)).
The server requires `--data`, runs the referee for every game and hosts the AI.
Accounts with sign-in are the default and public listeners use native TLS
([public-server.md](public-server.md)). Allied mana sharing and unit gifting are
described in [unit-gifting.md](unit-gifting.md). The headless test client is
`TAK_HEADLESS=1 takclient game ... --mpai` (debug builds).

## 1. Goals

- **Client–server topology.** All clients make one outbound TCP connection to a
  central server (`takserver`) reachable on the LAN or internet. Everything —
  lobby, game traffic — is proxied through it. No NAT traversal or port
  forwarding on any player's side.
- **Up to 8 players per game**, any mix of humans and AIs.
- **Up to 8 teams.** Default: every player/AI on its own team (free-for-all).
  Players on the same team share vision (fog of war); radar marks the minimap
  from a player's own units only, as in retail (`height-and-fog.md`).
- **Own color per player** (the retail art ships exactly 10 color variants).
- **AI players run on the server**, not on the host's machine. The host picks
  them in the room; the server simulates and commands them.
- **Control isolation:** a player commands only their own units — allies
  included cannot be commanded.
- **Named games with optional passwords**, chosen by the host when the game is
  created.
- **Game browser:** the server lists joinable (lobby-state) games and live
  (running, unjoinable) games.
- **Spectators** and [verified map transfer](map-transfer.md).
- **Durable sessions:** a player the server stops hearing from holds the game
  for up to 30 seconds -- in all, per game, over all of their stalls, counted
  from when they went quiet -- (everyone sees the countdown); back in time -- the
  same connection, or an automatic reconnect -- the game goes on, otherwise a
  server AI (Normal) takes the seat over (§4).

Not provided: mid-game diplomacy (teams are fixed at setup) and ratings. Wire
encryption is the server's native TLS; a server without it belongs on a trusted
network only (resume tokens, §4).

## 2. Architecture

```
   takclient (client)  ─┐
   takclient (client)  ─┼─ TCP ──►  takserver ── per-game: GameRoom
   takclient (client)  ─┘             │  ├─ command sequencer (tick authority)
                                    │  ├─ headless World (referee + AI host)

```

**Server-sequenced deterministic lockstep.** Every participant that needs game
state — each client, and the server itself — runs the identical sim (a
deterministic 30 Hz `World::tick` with periodic 64-bit state hashes). Clients
send their commands to the server; the server is the *only* clock: it assigns
every command (human or AI) to a tick, closes each tick on a fixed 30 Hz wall
schedule, and broadcasts one `TickBundle` per tick to all clients. A client may
only advance its sim through tick T once it has bundle T, and **clients never
apply their own commands locally** — every command takes the round trip through
the `issue()` → `apply()` funnel and executes only when its bundle arrives.

Causality note: a command issued against the client's view of tick T executes
at server tick S ≥ T (latency ≈ RTT + at most one bundle interval). This is
standard relay-sequenced lockstep, and safe because commands are *intent*
(move-to, attack-id) validated at execution time — a stale reference (unit died
in between) degrades to a no-op via the `owns()`/unit-lookup checks in
`apply()`. The server additionally pre-validates `owns()` against the referee
sim at the closing tick, so accept/reject is identical on every sim.

**Sequenced server events.** Anything that affects sim state but originates
from wall-clock server decisions — an AI taking over the seat of a player
whose disconnect wait ran out, a player leaving voluntarily — is **not** a
side-band notice: it is an *event record inside the TickBundle*, executing at
that bundle's tick on every sim, and therefore part of the log. This keeps
three properties simultaneously true: the log replays to the same end state, a
spectator reconstructs the same world as live clients, and the referee's hash
stays comparable. (Purely informational notices — connected/dropped
indicators, ping — are side-band `PlayerStatus` messages; they don't touch the
sim.) Every bundle carries its (possibly empty) event section.

Why this model (vs. authoritative state replication):

- Bandwidth is tiny and flat: ~35 bytes per command, one small frame per tick.
- No full World serialization or interpolation is needed.
- **AI-on-server falls out for free**: the server runs a sim per game (as
  referee), so an AI player is just another command source feeding the
  sequencer — exactly like a human, subject to the same validation.
- **Catch-up falls out for free**: the sequenced bundle log *is* the game; a
  spectator replays it headless to catch up, and a reconnecting player takes it
  from the first tick it lacks (§4). A log written to disk is a replay file.

Clients never gate on *each other*. A slow client only delays itself within its
flow-control lead — the server keeps closing ticks on schedule — and its own
command-to-effect latency equals its lag, so the client HUD shows a "behind by
N s" indicator. A client that stops the room (a hold past its lead, or nothing
at all for `kStallMs`, 8 s) is handled by the disconnect policy (§4).

**Client jitter buffer + adaptive playout.** Bundles are sequenced by the server
but *arrive* unevenly (network jitter, TCP retransmits). Draining "play every
bundle the instant it lands" turns each late bundle into a visible micro-stall.
So the client keeps a small receive buffer and paces playout on its own wall
clock, staying `netDelay_` bundles behind the newest received; a late bundle is
covered from that reserve, and only a gap deeper than the reserve stalls. This
is pure pacing — the same bundles play in the same order, so every sim and hash
stays byte-identical (`mpStep()`, `src/client/gameview_net.cpp`).

Two refinements make it self-tuning:
- **Auto-sizing** (the default; `TAK_NET_DELAY` overrides in debug builds — `0`
  disables the buffer, a positive integer pins a fixed depth): an active RTT
  probe (one ping/sec) plus a decaying-max of the measured bundle-arrival jitter
  size the reserve each frame — `clamp(2 + max(kJit, kRtt, kFrame), 2, cap)`
  ticks (`tak::net::jitterTargetTicks`, `src/net/pacing.h`) — so a clean LAN sits
  at 2 and a jittery WAN grows the cushion only as needed. The cap is
  `min(max(16, 16·speed), flowBufferLimit)`: never more than server flow control
  lets the client hold (`flowLeadTicks` less a Progress period, the round trip
  and the sim inbox), which would pin the servo at its floor. A bundle's
  lateness is measured against the *previous* poll and the jitter decays on
  wall time, so a client's own stall (loading, alt-tab, a menu) is not counted
  as network jitter (`ArrivalJitter`).
- **Servo playout** holds the reserve *at* that target instead of drifting: the
  sim clock runs slightly fast when the buffer is deep (shed latency) and slightly
  slow when it is shallow (rebuild the reserve) — `rate = 30·clamp(1 + 0.06·(buffered
  − target), 0.7, 1.3)` Hz. Equilibrium is exactly `buffered == target`, so added
  latency stays tight rather than accreting. A backlog deeper than target+60 (a
  rejoin replay, or a client that fell behind) is fast-forwarded, not paced.

Only game ticks are gated by this buffer; camera, zoom, and edge-scroll run every
render frame in `cameraFrame(dt)`, independent of the sim, so input feel is never
coupled to link latency.

*Test harness.* A synthetic link model (debug builds) injects receive delay on the
client with no server needed: `TAK_NET_BASE_MS` (constant one-way),
`TAK_NET_JITTER_MS` (uniform 0..N added), `TAK_NET_LOSS_PCT` (probability of a
~2·base retransmit spike). `TAK_NETBENCH=1` runs the headless client at a fixed
60 fps and reports `delay`, measured `rtt`, frames, and starved-frame `stalls`.
Measured over 15 s of an `--mpai` game, the servo cuts stalls roughly 10–12× on
lossy links against an unbuffered client (base60+jit60+loss5%: 28.2% → 2.3%;
base80+jit120+loss10%: 61.2% → 6.0%) while holding delay at 4–5 bundles.

### Trust model

The server stamps `Command.player` from the connection it arrived on and
discards whatever the client claimed, so no client can command another
player's units by setting the byte. Sim-level `owns()` checks remain in every
client as defense in depth. The server's own sim gives it a canonical state
hash for attribution — with one humility rule (§4, referee suspicion): when
everyone disagrees with the referee but agrees with each other, the referee
suspects *itself*.

### Game-data agreement + mods

Every peer reads its game files through a VFS over a retail install directory
(`hpi::mountRetailRoot`: root `*.hpi` + `Maps/*.kmp` + `Music/`, resolved by the
retail newest-date rule, plus one merged mod layer from `mods/`). Lockstep needs
every sim to feed on byte-identical *gameplay* data, so that's fingerprinted and
agreed:

- **`hpi::gameplayHash(vfs)`** — a content hash over just the files the sim reads
  (unit `.fbi`, weapon/side/game `.tdf`, build lists, features; **not** maps, which
  are per-game, and **not** cosmetics — art, models, animation, sound, music, GUI).
- Each game carries a **game-mods flag** (`GameOptions.gameMods`, 0/1). When on,
  the host's always-enabled `mods/game/always_enabled/<pack>` folders and its
  ticked `mods/game/<pack>` folders are packaged and transferred (see
  [Per-room game mods](#11-per-room-game-mods)); every player mounts that verified
  package at game start so its registry matches the referee's. Every host
  sends 1, single player and multiplayer alike (the room has no GAME MODS
  toggle); 0 comes only from a debug `--mods` launch and means no package
  and no game packs at all. Campaign missions are forced to 0.
- **Cosmetic mods are per player and never travel.** Each client lays on top of
  the room's package its own always-enabled `mods/cosmetic/always_enabled/<pack>`
  folders (every room) and its ticked `mods/cosmetic/<pack>` folders (every room
  but a campaign one), through the cosmetic keep-filter (`!affectsGameplay`, no
  `features/`, no `ai/`). That filter strips everything `gameplayHash` reads, so
  the Loaded hash is unchanged by them. The handshake mount, the referee data and
  map packages (`maps::build`) never include any cosmetic layer, so a cosmetic
  `maps/*.tdf` cannot reach a map digest.
- Enforcement is two-stage. The **`Hello`** carries the client's *pure-retail*
  gameplay hash (mounted with no mods), so the base game files must match for
  everyone regardless of mods — a modified retail file is rejected at connect. At
  **`Loaded`** the client sends its gameplay hash *with the room's game mods*, and
  the referee (mounted with the same package) rejects a mismatch — so a player
  lacking or differing on a game mod is caught before tick 0 rather than as a
  mid-game desync. `takserver` refuses to host without `--data`, so every game
  has the referee's hash.

## 3. Determinism contract

Lockstep at 8 players lives or dies on bit-identical simulation, so the
contract is stated, enforced, and narrow:

- **Same protocol version, not the same binary.** The `Hello` carries a build
  id, but the server only logs it; it refuses a client whose `kNetVersion`
  differs. Linux, Windows and macOS builds with the same `kNetVersion` play
  together (the sim's math is implementation-independent, as below, and a
  cross-build golden hash is checked in CI).
- The sim (and anything it calls) is compiled without `-ffast-math` and with
  `-ffp-contract=off` pinned in CMake for EVERY target (a directory-wide
  `add_compile_options`, so the server's AI and any sim header inlined into
  client/server code are covered too -- see `fp_contract_test`).
- The sim's transcendentals (`sin`/`cos`/`atan2`/`sqrt` in movement/turning)
  route through a small deterministic math shim (`sim/detmath`) rather than
  raw libm — libm results differ across implementations and versions even on
  the same architecture. `tools/check-detmath.sh` enforces it, so builds need
  not share a libm.
- Data gate: the gameplay hash at `Hello` and `Loaded` (above) and the verified
  map package digest; the server refuses mixed-data games with a readable error.
- The AI's RNG is outside the sim and cannot desync the world — only its
  *commands* matter, and those are sequenced like everyone else's.
- Any navigation cache the sim keeps is a **pure memo**: its content is a
  function of (nav grid, goal, domain) only — never of when or whether it was
  built — because the server's AI queries build cache entries clients never
  build. Query-only helpers (`pathExists`) stay query-only. Breaking this
  desyncs only server-vs-client configurations, the nastiest kind of bug.
- The fog the player sees is display, built locally from the per-player sight
  plane every sim keeps and hashes (`height-and-fog.md`), so per-client team
  fog cannot desync. The referee draws nothing.

## 4. The server (`takserver`)

A headless binary that needs the same game data as clients (it runs the sim
and the AI): point it at the install with `--data`. No SDL, no rendering — it
links the sim, data loaders, `net` and the `ai` module only.

- **Lobby service.** Holds the game registry. Handles create / list / join /
  leave / seat changes / room edits / chat / start. One TCP port (default 7677)
  for everything; a connection is in lobby state or attached to one game. If the
  host leaves or disconnects **pre-start** (a host watching its room as a
  spectator too), host powers pass to the next human in the lobby (the game
  dissolves if none remain; an unstarted room nobody is in is dissolved in any
  case). In a running game they belong to the host's **seat**: a host that
  reconnects is the host again under its new connection; when the seat leaves
  for good (a leave, or an AI takeover) they pass to the first seated player
  still connected and playing (else to one held for its reconnect, which takes
  them when it is back), or to nobody, and the host's pause ends with it. The
  "host" is a player with room permissions; in a running game it matters only
  for pause and speed. A LOCAL SERVER's (`--lan`) game is its host's: it closes
  for everyone when the host leaves, in the lobby or in the game.
- **Capacity limits.** `--max-games` caps the rooms (a `CreateGame` past it is
  refused: "server game capacity reached"); `--max-running-games` caps the
  running games and with them the simulation workers (a START past it is
  refused: "server running-game capacity reached; retry later"). Both are
  refusals that keep the connection (§5).
- **GameRoom.** One per game: player slots (up to 8), the sequencer, the
  headless referee sim, one `ai::Controller` per AI slot, the bundle log, and
  the room's settings (map, `GameOptions`, game-mod package).
- **Tick loop.** Fixed 30 Hz per room. Each tick: collect queued client
  commands (stamped, validated, capped — §5 hardening), run each due AI
  controller (they emit commands into the same queue), append due sequenced
  events (leaves, AI takeovers), close the bundle, append it to the log,
  broadcast, advance the referee sim (on the room's own worker, §10). AI
  controllers think once per 30 ticks (1 s cadence), staggered across AI slots.
  On `Resume` after a pause the tick closer rebases its wall-clock schedule — no
  burst of catch-up ticks.
- **Desync referee.** Clients send `StateHash` every 30 ticks. Clients lag the
  referee by RTT + buffering, so the server keeps a bounded ring of its own
  per-tick hashes to compare against late-arriving client hashes. A
  mismatching client gets a `Desynced` notice and its game ends (a reconnect
  would only continue its wrong world, so it never reconnects); when its
  connection goes, the disconnect wait below runs and an AI takes the seat.
  **Referee suspicion rule:** if a hash round shows the clients agreeing with
  each other and disagreeing with the referee, the server suspects its own sim
  (e.g. a server-only AI code path bug), logs loudly, stops dropping clients,
  and flags the room for investigation instead of drop-looping every innocent client.
- **Hash breadth.** To attribute desyncs quickly, `stateHash` (§6) also folds in
  projectile owner + quantized position and order targets — counts alone let
  same-count divergences hide until damage lands.
- **Disconnect policy.** The rule: if a player effectively
  stops communicating, the game waits 30 seconds for them, paused, with a
  countdown; if they are still not communicating after that, they are dropped
  and an AI at Normal plays their units. The 30 seconds are a budget per seat
  per game, not per stall, spent from the player's last contact (not from when
  the countdown appears), so nobody can hold a game indefinitely by going
  quiet and answering just in time, again and again -- not even with silences
  too short to start a wait.
  - *Stopping.* A seated human in a running game (past tick 0, not defeated)
    stops communicating when the server has received nothing from it for
    `kStallMs` (8 s; a healthy client reports progress every few ticks and
    answers the server's 5 s keepalive ping, and the game client pings once a
    second), or at once when its connection closes without a `LeaveGame`. The
    server then sets that seat's wait deadline to its last contact plus what
    is left of its budget (`kDropWaitMs`, 30 s per seat per game) -- the
    silence before the wait is already spent, so a first full stall counts
    down from 22 and is taken over 30 s after the player went quiet -- and
    closes no tick while any seat is waiting: every peer freezes on the same
    tick. A silence that has already used what was left is taken over at once,
    with no `Waiting`.
    `Msg::Waiting` (the seats and each one's milliseconds left) goes to the
    whole room whenever the set changes, and to a spectator or a reconnected
    player as it arrives; clients draw `WAITING FOR <name> 27`, one line and
    countdown per seat, so several stalls each run their own clock. A player
    alone in the room (single-player) gets no wait: nobody else is affected, and
    when its link goes the room ends.
  - *The budget.* A wait that ends charges the seat's budget for the whole
    silence, from its last contact to its return, in whole seconds, rounded up
    and never past what is left (the countdown shows whole seconds: back while
    it reads 1 spends the budget). The next stall's countdown starts from the
    rest less that stall's own silence -- after 20 s spent, from 2 -- and a
    stall whose silence has used what was left is taken over at once, with no
    wait and no `Waiting` for it.
  - *Short holds.* A silence shorter than `kStallMs` starts no wait but can
    still stop the game: flow control (`canAdvance`) will not run the room more
    than the seat's lead past its last acknowledged tick, so after the lead
    (under a second at a normal ping) the room stands until the seat speaks
    again. The server measures that directly: wherever a tick would close, a
    seat is *holding* the game while the room is past `ackTick + leadTicks`
    for it. The rule: each hold is timed from when the server first finds the
    room stopped on the seat to when it no longer is (a pause or another seat's
    wait suspends the clock; only time the game really stood for this seat
    counts), and a hold that ends is charged its length minus a 1 s grace
    (`kHoldGraceMs`), in whole seconds rounded up, never past what is left; one
    of 1 s or less costs nothing, so ordinary network jitter is free. A hold
    that reaches the grace plus what the budget has left is taken over then and
    there, as a wait that runs out. The same applies to a seat that talks but
    does not acknowledge (a stuck client still answering pings) and to a
    reconnected seat catching up its missed ticks. A hold that turns into a
    wait (the silence reaches `kStallMs`) is not charged twice: the wait
    charges the silence from the last contact, and only what the hold held
    before that contact (a seat that talked without keeping up, then went
    quiet) is charged as a hold. Holds count only where a wait would (someone
    else to wait with, past tick 0). The accounting is the server's alone and is not sim
    state: peers see it only as the `ms left` in `Waiting` (which they count
    down) and the `AiTakeover` tick, which the replay records like any event, so
    clients, referee and replay agree. Each `Waiting` also ends with the
    recipient's own budget (`running`, `ms`: its running countdown, else what
    its seat has left, which the client shortens by its own silence since it
    last heard from the server), so a client whose link drops counts down and
    retries for as long as the server will really wait, not a fresh 30 s; a
    hold that is charged sends the seat's client a fresh `Waiting` for this.
    Silence before the first tick, or before the client has loaded, is not
    charged (loading has its own deadlines): a connection that closes then
    counts down from the close. `Waiting` is not recorded and changes no sim
    state. Like the budget, the hold accounting is wall-clock time on the
    server alone.
  - *Coming back.* Talking again on the same connection inside the window (a
    frozen frame, a hitch, a Wi-Fi blip TCP rode out) ends that seat's wait. A
    client whose link actually dropped reconnects by itself: a new connection,
    the same login (the client keeps the login's SCRAM keys for the session;
    the password itself is gone; a session signed in by token spends its next
    sign-in token instead), then `Rejoin{game, resume token, fromTick}`,
    `fromTick` being the first tick whose bundle it never received. The server
    answers `Reseated{slot, rotated token, fromTick, logEnd}`, then what no
    bundle carries (`LobbyState`: the game speed and the host as they are now;
    `Pause` while the host has the game paused; `Waiting`), and streams the
    log from `fromTick`; the client keeps its world (no rebuild from tick 0)
    and treats the ticks before `logEnd` as history -- its own orders wait and
    its acknowledgements are not counted until it is through them. A `Rejoin`
    also replaces a seat's old connection the server has not seen go yet.
    The resume token is ≥64-bit random and single-use (rotated on every
    reconnect).
  - *Taken over.* When a wait runs out the seat's connection, if still open,
    is closed (`Bye`: an AI took over your seat), and from the next tick the
    seat is a server AI at Normal: the same player id, units, buildings and
    mana. A sequenced `Event::AiTakeover{player}` in that tick's bundle marks
    the player computer-owned (`Player::automaticGates`, hashed) on every peer,
    the referee and the replay; the server adds an `ai::Controller` for the
    seat (only with no tick in flight, since the worker owns the controllers
    while one runs), which reads the empire afresh every think -- home is its
    buildings' centroid, producers and army are whatever it has -- so starting
    mid-game needs nothing from the opening. Its commands enter the bundles
    like any AI seat's, so peers and replays simply apply them. A reconnect
    after that is refused: "the wait ran out: an AI took over your seat".
  - *Leaving on purpose:* `LeaveGame` (the game client sends it when the player
    quits a running game from the menu) is a `Leave` event at once -- the units
    go inert, no wait. A defeated player's departure never waits either.
  - *Spectators* catch up by rebuilding the world from tick 0, replaying the
    whole bundle log; seated players never do.
- **Log format.** Bundles including events, prefixed by a header: format
  version, build id, data checksum, and the full `GameStarting` payload (slot
  table, map, options, per-AI seeds) — that header is exactly what makes a log
  a self-contained replay file (§15). Logs are memory-bounded per room; a game
  that exceeds its replay memory is stopped.

## 5. Protocol

Framing: `u32 LE length` + `u8 kind` + payload, over one TCP stream with
`TCP_NODELAY`. All multi-byte integers little-endian. The `Command` wire format
is 35 bytes (43 for the two area commands, §14); the `player` byte is
server-assigned on receipt.

**Handshake.** `Hello` carries protocol version, engine build id (binary content
hash), and the pure-retail gameplay hash. The server rejects a protocol or data
mismatch with a human-readable reason.

### Lobby messages (client ⇄ server)

| Msg | Payload | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `Hello` / `Welcome` | proto ver, build id, data hash / assigned session id | version + data gate |
| `SetName` | display name | used only by a server run with `--no-auth`; otherwise players sign in to an account |
| `AuthToken` / `AuthRevoke` | username, sign-in token | TLS only (`src/net/auth.h`). In place of `AuthBegin`: a password login's `AuthResult` carries a token, which **Game Select** spends to sign in with no password (the `AuthResult` carries the next one) and quitting revokes. The server holds per-account hashes in memory, and a login's line of tokens ends 12 hours after the password however often it rotates. A token used twice ends its line, except a resend within 30 seconds after a lost reply; a bad token counts in the login throttle and sends the player to the normal password prompt |
| `ListGames` / `GameList` | — / entries: id, name, map, players/capacity, state (lobby/running), passworded, uptime, allowSpectators | running games listed but unjoinable |
| `CreateGame` | name, password, map id, mission, options, capacity, spectate, private | creator becomes host; an empty name is the server's `"<name>'s Game"`; a name past 32 printable-ASCII bytes or a password past 128 is answered with `JoinResult(0, why)`, and so is a server at its game limit (`--max-games`: "server game capacity reached"); a random map's capacity is its player count, read by the server |
| `JoinGame` / `JoinResult` | game id, password? / ok, slot (0xFF = watching), why, room revision | error: full, bad password, running; every JoinResult carries the room's revision, so a READY sent before the first `LobbyState` counts. A refusal keeps the connection: the client stays in the game list with the reason. `JoinResult(ok)` is what puts a client in a room, always before that room's first `LobbyState` (see [Room scope](#room-scope-what-a-client-takes-and-when)) |
| `SlotUpdate` | slot #, {human/AI/closed}, faction, color, team, ready, AI level, room revision | players set their own; host sets any (host resolves conflicts, assigns AIs); only the server seats a human, so the host can neither change a seated slot's type nor make an empty one human -- such an edit (e.g. one sent before a seat move landed) is dropped. Only a seat's own player changes its READY, and a guest's READY on an older revision than the room's is stored as not ready |
| `LobbyState` | `RoomState`: id, name, map, mission, options, host, maps ready, capacity, passworded, revision, change bits, map serial, the 8 slots | broadcast on every change |
| `SetGameOptions` | full `GameOptions` | host only; in the lobby the server adopts them (see [Room editing](#room-editing)) and rebroadcasts `LobbyState`; in-game only `speed` takes effect (if `speedUnlock`), pushed via `SpeedUpdate` |
| `SetRoomMap` | serial, map id, capacity, MAP SCENARIO, start mode | host only, lobby only, never a mission or Benchmark room; answered by the `LobbyState` carrying the serial, after a `RoomError` when refused |
| `SetRoomInfo` | flags (1 name, 2 password), name, password | host only, lobby only; only the flagged fields apply; no player is unreadied. The game client does not send it (see [Room editing](#room-editing)) |
| `RoomError` | request (1 map, 2 info), serial, reason | server → host: a refusal it can act on, never fatal, always followed by a `LobbyState` |
| `Chat` | text | lobby and in-game |
| `Kick` | slot # | host only |
| `MoveSeat` | slot # (0xFF = watch) | a seated player (the host too) takes an OPEN seat inside the map capacity, lobby only; not in a campaign mission room; side, colour, team and ready move with the player, the old seat opens with the target's colour and team; the server answers the mover with `JoinResult` (its new slot), then broadcasts `LobbyState`; the host may leave its seat to watch (0xFF) and sit down again; anything else is ignored. The room's MOVE HERE is live only under BY SLOT start locations, or in a scenario whose seats have armies or rules of their own (greyed otherwise) |
| `StartGame` | — | host only; server validates: every human ready, colors unique, players ≤ map start positions. A START the server will not run is answered to the host with `MapError` (room, reason), which the room shows as CANNOT START: the map has no scenario, a seat the scenario needs is empty, the match cannot be set up, the game mods cannot be loaded, or the server is at its running-game limit (`--max-running-games`: "server running-game capacity reached; retry later"). The room stays as it is and the host may press START again |
| `GameStarting` | final slot table, map id, options, per-AI RNG seeds, resume token | clients load and report `Loaded`; server starts when all humans are loaded; a `Loaded` timeout kicks that player back to the lobby and re-opens the slot (host decides: re-fill or start without) |

### Refusals and `Reject`

`Reject` ends the connection: the client shows DISCONNECTED with the reason, whether
or not the server also closes the socket. It is kept for what is fatal by design: a
protocol violation (a malformed handshake or login, an invalid pathfinder byte, a
random-map id this build cannot read), a refused sign-in step or a login rate limit,
a version or data mismatch (protocol, retail data at `Hello`, game data at `Loaded`,
a map or mission the server's data cannot referee), a benchmark, stress or campaign
request on a public server, a game the server stops (replay memory, a failed
simulation), and a LOCAL SERVER's game closing with its host.

A request a player may ordinarily make is refused with its own message and the
connection kept: `JoinResult(0, why)` for `CreateGame`, `JoinGame`, `Spectate` and
`Rejoin` (the server's game limit included), `MapError` to the host for a `StartGame`
(the running-game limit included), `RoomError` for the host's room edits. A full
server therefore refuses CREATE or START and the player stays connected.

### Room scope: what a client takes, and when

The server sends a room's messages only to the clients it has in that room, and it
puts a client there with a message of that client's own before any other:

| The client asked | The server sends, in order |
|---|---|
| `CreateGame`, `JoinGame` | `JoinResult(ok)`, then the room's first `LobbyState` (then the package offers) |
| `Spectate` | the room's `MapOffer` / `ModOffer`, `GameStarting` (slot 0xFF), `Waiting` while a countdown runs, then the bundle log |
| `Rejoin` | `Reseated`, then `LobbyState`, `Pause` while the host has the game paused, `Waiting`, then the missed bundles |
| `MoveSeat`, or the host's map moved its seat | `JoinResult(ok)` with the new seat, then `LobbyState` (already in the room) |

A host succession is a `LobbyState` to the clients already in the room, and no room
outlives its game, so nothing enters a room by `LobbyState` alone. `MpClient::takes`
holds the client to that: a room's messages (the table, `RoomError`, the map and
game-mod transfer, chat, voice, `GameStarting` and everything of a running game) are
acted on only from that first message until the client leaves, and are otherwise
dropped unread. A `LobbyState` never opens a room, and one for another room than the
client's is not its room's.

**A left room stays left.** What the server sent before it took a client's
`LeaveGame` still arrives after the client has left: a table sent as a package
verified, a seat the map just moved. `LeaveGame` has no answer, so
`MpClient::leaveGame` sends a `Ping` right behind it: the server answers a
connection's messages in order, so every room message before that `Ping`'s `Pong`
was sent before the leave and is dropped, and what follows the `Pong` answers what
the client sent after it. The same call takes back a request still on its way
(CANCEL in the browser's windows, or NO ANSWER): `LeaveGame` follows the request to
the server, which leaves the room or watched game it opened for it, and the
request's answer -- a yes with its table, a no, a watched game's `GameStarting` and
bundles -- arrives before the `Pong` and is dropped, so it is never taken for the
answer to the next request.

A watched game's stream is taken before its `GameStarting` is: that message waits in
`MpClient` until the packages it names have arrived and verified
(`MpClient::watchLoading`), while the bundle log, a `Pause`, a `Waiting` and chat
lines behind it are stored. `leaveGame` therefore also clears what a game's stream
left (the buffered bundles and their tick counter, the pause, the wait, chat, voice),
so a watch taken back during that wait leaves nothing under the tick numbers of the
next game on the connection. The server takes a `LeaveGame` whatever the request
budgets say (it is exempt from the shared ones, as `Ping` is): it has no answer, so
a dropped one would leave its sender browsing the game list while the room still
seated it.

### Room editing

The host picks the map and every rule in the room itself, before START; there is
no separate create screen. The server keeps one rule for what counts as a change:
every host request it accepts in the lobby that changes the room, except the name,
the password, the speed and the host's own READY, moves the room's revision on
(`RoomState::roomRev`, from 1) and unreadies every ready guest in the same step,
before the broadcast (`Server::bumpRules`). `changeBits` says what the last one
changed (map, scenario, options, players, mods, capacity: `net::RoomChange`) so a
guest's room can say what happened without inferring it. The changes are option
updates, the map, MAP SCENARIO, a new game-mod package, a seat edit (a seat other
than the host's own, or the host's own side, colour or team), the host moving
seat, watching or sitting down again, and a KICK. A guest's own edits unready
nobody.

- **Stale READY.** `SlotUpdate` carries the revision its sender last saw. A
  guest's READY on an older one is stored as not ready (the other fields apply),
  so a READY clicked on a view older than the host's change never readies a guest
  for a game it has not seen. `JoinResult` carries the revision too. The host
  never writes another human's READY. A seat that opens or closes, a seat its
  player left, and a newcomer's seat are not ready.
- **Options** (`SetGameOptions`): a skirmish lobby adopts every option but MAP
  SCENARIO, including the unit limit, the pathfinder and POWER CODES; a Benchmark
  lobby keeps its unit limit and has no game mods; a campaign mission's lobby
  adopts only the speed and ALLOW SPECTATORS. A speed change alone is no change.
- **The map** (`SetRoomMap`: serial, map id, capacity, MAP SCENARIO, start mode).
  The client sends one at a time, numbered past the room's `mapSerial`; every
  well-formed request with a new serial is answered by the `LobbyState` that
  carries it, after a `RoomError` when refused (more seated humans than the map
  has starts, a random-map recipe this build cannot make). A random map's
  capacity is its player count, read by the server; a file map's is the host's
  count, as at CreateGame. MAP SCENARIO is forced off for a random map, a stress
  test and a Benchmark; the start mode applies whenever the scenario ends up off,
  so turning it off restores the host's choice in the same change. An unchanged
  map, scenario and start mode is answered to the host alone. A new map drops the
  room's map package and every client's transfer of the old one
  (`Server::resetRoomMap`); the game mods are untouched. The host's client builds
  a file map into a pending package and makes it the room's only when the answer
  arrives, then offers it as usual.
- **Capacity.** One plan (`net/roomseats.h` `planCapacity`) is applied by the
  server and read by the room to warn: a human past the new capacity moves to the
  lowest OPEN seat below it, else the lowest CLOSED one, else the highest AI seat
  (that AI is removed), keeping its side, colour and team; every AI past it is
  removed; the seats past it close and the seats it gains open. A moved player
  is told its seat with `JoinResult` before the table.
- **Name and password.** A game's name and password are set when it is created
  (`CreateGame`) and are static in the room. A name is 1-32 printable-ASCII bytes
  after trimming, a password 0-128. `MpClient::createGame` sends only the
  printable ASCII of a name, cut to 32 bytes, so a remembered or typed name the
  server would refuse still creates the room. The browser and the LAN
  announcement read the room live. The server also takes `SetRoomInfo` (only the
  flagged fields apply, since a lobby successor never knew the password and a
  rename must not clear it), though the game client never sends it. Known limit:
  the table carries only whether there is a password, so a client forgets the
  one it shows behind SHOW when a table says the lock is gone, and cannot tell a
  password changed in one step by another client's `SetRoomInfo`.
- **The game browser's windows and the room's name line**
  (`gameview_lobby.cpp`: `BrowserWindow`, `browserStep`). The browser has no
  password field. CREATE opens a modal window for GAME NAME (default
  `"<account>'s Game"`, up to `kRoomNameMax` printable-ASCII bytes; blank means
  the default) and PASSWORD (OPTIONAL); a click on a locked game's row, or WATCH
  on a locked live game, opens a password window instead of sending anything.
  Both hide the password as pips behind a SHOW / HIDE button, and both answer
  their own request: JOINING... / OPENING THE GAME... while it waits, the
  server's refusal (`CANNOT JOIN: wrong password`) with the text kept, NO ANSWER
  FROM THE SERVER after 10 s (the next request first gives the stale one up with
  `LeaveGame`), THE GAME HAS CLOSED / STARTED when the list no longer offers
  it. A WATCH the server took whose map or game mods this client still has to
  download is answered, not silent (`MpClient::watchLoading`: its `GameStarting`
  waits for them): no clock runs on it, the window (or, for an unlocked game,
  the browser's bottom line, with a CANCEL of its own) says what is arriving
  (DOWNLOADING MAP 37%), WATCH stays greyed and CANCEL takes it back. If that
  game ends meanwhile the list, which the server answers again, no longer has it:
  THE GAME HAS CLOSED. CANCEL or Esc while a window's own `JoinGame`, `Spectate`
  or `CreateGame` is still unanswered takes it back (`browserTakeBack`, which NO
  ANSWER's retry uses too): the password that went with it is wiped and
  `MpClient::leaveGame` does the rest -- `LeaveGame` follows the request, so a
  room or watched game the server opens for it is left there at once, and its
  answer, yes or no, is dropped when it arrives (see
  [Room scope](#room-scope-what-a-client-takes-and-when)). The browser is free
  again straight away: the next request's answer cannot be taken for the old
  one's. (A window opened while a game's row, clicked just before, is still
  unanswered says WAITING FOR THE SERVER... beside its greyed button.) A server
  at its game limit refuses CREATE in the window like any other refusal
  (CANNOT OPEN A GAME: server game capacity reached), with the typed name and
  password kept.
  The lobby's screens lie over one another (a window's CREATE over the room's
  LEAVE, its CANCEL and LEAVE over the list's rows, a row over the password
  window's buttons), so a press aimed at the screen before is dropped
  (`lobbyPressStale`): the rest of a double click that changed the screen under
  the pointer, and any press within 300 ms of the new screen's first frame (a
  room that opens or closes as the button goes down); the client's log says so.
  An unlocked game is joined at once and its refusal stays on the browser's CANNOT JOIN
  line, which also says NO ANSWER FROM THE SERVER for a request no window is
  waiting on. In every multiplayer room the name line is static, for the host
  as for a guest: the name, then LOCKED, or, when this client's player typed
  the password (the CREATE or password window, or CONNECT TO SERVER for a LAN
  game), PASSWORD with eight pips and the same SHOW / HIDE (the name is laid
  out the same either way; a shown password has the room it leaves, shrinks,
  then is cut with "..."). That copy is kept
  only while in the room (`roomPass_`, wiped on leaving); the password never
  appears in a log. A shown password is drawn in the MODERN face in either UI
  FONT (`GameView::ExactText`): CLASSIC draws capitals only, and a password
  must read as it was typed.
- **Watching.** The seated host may leave its seat to watch (`MoveSeat` 0xFF,
  answered `JoinResult` 0xFF; ALLOW SPECTATORS does not apply) and take an OPEN
  seat again; a room started with its host watching gives it slot 0xFF.
- **Transfers.** `MapRequest`/`ModRequest` are `room, digest, xfer` and every
  `MapChunk`/`ModChunk` is `room, xfer, offset, bytes`: the receiving side picks
  `xfer`, a per-connection counter, so a chunk left over from an earlier request
  (the map changed, or changed back) is dropped quietly instead of failing the
  transfer, and a request for a package the sender no longer holds is ignored. A
  newer request restarts an upload from offset 0. The server keeps a map
  validation and a game-mod validation per client apart, so a map change never
  cancels a game-mod validation; it counts only live validations against its cap,
  answers a host's offer of the package it has already verified with that
  package's offer, and ignores an offer of a map the room no longer plays. A host
  offer refused for a busy server is offered again after 2, 4 and 8 s.
- **The client's room** (`src/client/gameview_room.cpp`,
  `gameview_mappicker.cpp`, `roomchanges.{h,cpp}`). Play the Machine and a LOCAL
  SERVER host's START/CONNECT send `CreateGame` at once
  (`GameView::createRoomFromPrefs`), and so does the browser's CREATE once its
  window has the game's name and password, from the remembered set of the room's
  kind, `Settings::spRoom` or `mpRoom` (rules, map or random-map recipe, map sort,
  game-mod packs; single player and multiplayer remember theirs separately). A
  remembered map that cannot be built falls back to the launch's map, then to the
  generator's default recipe, and the room says why. Only the host's own clicks
  are written back, one field at a time, and a map only when the server accepts
  it; never the name, password, watching or MAP SCENARIO, and never from a
  harness, a `--play-map` room, a mission or a Benchmark. The left column's
  options block sends `SetGameOptions` (cells for MAP SCENARIO send `SetRoomMap`)
  and the CHANGE MAP panel's PICK `SetRoomMap` with the capacity `seatsFor` gives
  the map (start positions, widened for its scenario). The panel greys a map with
  fewer seats than the room's seated humans and warns which AIs a PICK removes
  (`planCapacity`). A guest diffs each new `LobbyState` against the last
  (`roomChanges`, with the server's `changeBits`), flashes the changed cells and
  seats and shows one note (`HOST CHANGED FOG OF WAR -- READY AGAIN`);
  multiplayer also adds a SYSTEM chat line. Single player's WATCH is `MoveSeat`
  0xFF, after which the client seats random-race AIs in the open seats when fewer
  than two are seated. A `--play-map` room keeps its map (no CHANGE MAP, LEAVE
  reads QUIT); mission and Benchmark rooms are read-only. Debug builds drive the
  room through the same members with `TAK_ROOM_SCRIPT` (`tools/room_flow_test.py`).

AI seats carry their level in `SlotInfo.aiLevel`: 0-4 our Defensive, Easy,
Normal, Hard and Absurd, 5 Absurdly Defensive (every peer derives its double
income and defensive stance from the level), 6 Classic, shown to players as
RETAIL (a server-side port of the retail AI, `ai::ClassicBrain`; its seat gets
exactly a Normal seat's match config), and 7 Passive (run as Easy with no
exploring and builders held near home; an Easy seat's match config). A level of
8 or more is stored as Normal. A campaign mission's strategic computer players
are always Classic. The server's classic AI tells the sims its squads with
`Cmd::AiGroup`, applied only for a computer-owned player and never accepted from
a client.

### Game messages

| Msg | Payload | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `PlayerCommands` | n × Command | client → server; player byte ignored/overwritten |
| `OrderBegin` / `OrderMembers` / `OrderCommit` / `OrderAbort` | serial, template Command, shape, count / serial, member deltas (≤ 2,048) / serial, count, digest / serial | client → server: one explicit selection order as a transaction; the server puts the committed order whole into ONE TickBundle (`Cmd::Order`, its activation tick). Legion clients send their selection verbs this way, Retail clients keep per-unit commands. `net/protocol.h` beside `kOrderMaxMembers`, `server/orders.h`, [legion-pathfinding.md](legion-pathfinding.md) (Convoys: selection orders and arrival areas) |
| `TickBundle` | tick u32, n × Command (ascending player, then arrival order), m × Event | server → all clients, 30/s; empty bundles are the clock; every bundle has its event section (§2) |
| `StateHash` | tick u32, hash u64 | client → server, every 30 ticks |
| `Desynced` | tick, reason | server → one client; its game ends (no reconnect) |
| `Pause` / `Resume` | cause, player | the host's pause (`SetPause`): server stops closing ticks, never expires; ends if the host leaves the game |
| `Waiting` | n × (slot, ms left), own (running, ms) | the seats the room is waiting for (§4 disconnect policy); no tick closes while n > 0 |
| `SpeedUpdate` | speed (tenths, 10 = 1×) | server → all; host changed speed mid-game (needs `speedUnlock`); re-cadences tick pacing, not the per-tick `dt`, so the sim stays deterministic |
| `PlayerStatus` | slot, {connected, dropped, left} + ping | informational only — never sim-affecting (sim-affecting lifecycle is an Event in the bundle) |
| `Rejoin` | game id, resume token, fromTick | a reconnect inside the disconnect wait → `Reseated` (slot, rotated token, fromTick, logEnd), then the bundles from fromTick → live bundles |
| `Bye` | reason | clean shutdown both ways |

Bundle **Event** records (u8 kind + payload): `Forfeit{player}` (1, explicit
surrender), `Leave{player}` (2, voluntary, units per forfeit rule), and
`AiTakeover{player}` (4, the disconnect wait ran out; a server Normal AI plays the
seat from this tick, the player becomes computer-owned). Kind 3 is reserved and
refused. Defeat itself is *not* an event — it's derived deterministically inside
the sim from unit state, so every sim concludes it independently on the same tick.

Self-destruct (Ctrl+D) is `Cmd::Destroy`, through the command path like every
other world change; the stress-spawn keys are disabled in networked games. The
AI's world changes map onto the ordinary commands (`Train`, `Build`,
`AttackMove`, ...).

### Voice chat

Voice is **presentation only**: it never enters a TickBundle, the replay log, the
referee or `World::stateHash`, and the sim is unchanged by it. The server relays it
beside the game on three messages (`net/protocol.h` beside `kVoiceMaxOpus`):

| Msg | Payload | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `VoiceListen` | u8 on | client → server: this connection wants voice (voice chat switched on). Off by default, so the headless harness, a benchmark and anyone with voice off are sent none |
| `VoiceUp` | u16 seq, u8 recipients, u8 flags, u16 len, Opus | client → server: one 20 ms frame (48 kHz mono, ~24 kbit/s, in-band FEC), `recipients` = the talker's diplomacy VOICE mask. Flags: START (resets the receiver), END (key released, no audio) |
| `VoiceDown` | u32 talker id, u8 slot (0xFF spectator), u16 seq, u8 flags, u16 len, Opus, [str name] | server → client; the name rides on START frames and every 25th (`kVoiceHasName`) |

Recipients follow the **chat rules exactly**: before the game runs, or for mask
0xff, the whole room including spectators; otherwise the seated players whose bit
is set. Never back to the talker, never to a connection catching up (`replaying`)
or one that has not sent `VoiceListen 1`. In a running game spectators hear and
read a seated player only when the sender ticks them (`Chat`'s trailing u8,
`VoiceUp`'s `kVoiceSpectators` flag, which the server strips before `VoiceDown`);
a spectator's own chat and voice reach nobody.

Voice must never cost the game anything. Relayed frames go out through
`Conn::sendLow`: a separate queue that joins the byte stream only once every
ordinary frame queued so far has left, holds at most 16 frames (the newest win),
and refuses frames while 64 KiB of game traffic waits. That ordering holds inside
the program; once bytes are handed to the operating system they are sent in
order, so voice also waits for the kernel: a batch (at most 1 KiB) joins the
stream only while the kernel holds under 2 KiB for that peer, unsent or not yet
acknowledged (`kernelQueued`: `SIOCOUTQ` on Linux, `SO_NWRITE` on macOS; on
Windows `SIO_TCP_INFO`, Windows 10 1703 or later, as the bytes `send()` accepted --
counted by `Conn`, or the TLS socket BIO's count -- minus `BytesOut - BytesRetrans -
BytesInFlight`). Where the kernel cannot answer, voice is dropped rather than sent
ungated (ungated, Windows lets a talker's voice fill Winsock's 64 KiB send buffer
ahead of every `Progress`). A tick bundle queued later finds at most about 3 KiB
of voice ahead of it whatever the link speed, and on a link the game already
fills voice overflows its queue and is dropped. The server also caps each client
socket's unsent kernel queue at 16 KiB (`TCP_NOTSENT_LOWAT`, `limitUnsent`), so a
backlog of game traffic waits in the program where the send-backlog limits see it.

What the sender's kernel cannot show -- a slow reader's receive buffer, or a few
KiB of voice already ahead of a `Progress` on a link of a few kbit/s -- is caught
at each end by how late the game's own traffic is:

- **The talker's uplink** (`MpClient::sendVoice`). While transmitting, the client
  pings the server four times a second (every two seconds while voice is on, for a
  quiet baseline). A round trip more than max(100 ms, 4 ticks) above the lowest one
  (back, or still out) means its own voice is queueing ahead of its `Progress` and
  commands: voice is held -- an END closes the transmission, the queued voice is
  thrown away, captured frames are dropped -- for a back-off of 5 s doubling to
  60 s (forgotten after 2 quiet minutes), and resumes with a START once the probe
  is quiet. The Pong is read once a rendered frame, so a probe is judged by the
  least it can have taken: from its Ping to the last read that found the socket
  empty of it, not to the read that found it, so a talker whose machine stutters
  (a 180 ms frame every 0.7 s on a fast link) is not held.
  `voice_uplink_test` (all platforms, Windows included) talks over a 2500 B/s
  uplink: no `Progress` waits more than ~0.4 s, where without the hold Linux
  queues up to 2.4 s and Windows 5.5 s after 15 s and 22 s after 60 s; and with
  180 ms and 250 ms frames on a fast link nothing is held.
- **A listener's downlink** (`Server::voiceBehind`). `Progress` reports the newest
  tick that has *arrived* as well as the one processed. In a running game the server
  stops voice to a listener whose arrival lags the room by more than 3/4 of the lead
  it would have on an idle link (`flowLeadTicks` at its lowest reported round trip),
  drops its queued voice, and resumes once it is back within half that lead, after
  the same back-off. Arrival, not processing: a slow *machine* has its bundles in
  hand and runs them late, and in a room it holds back it lags by its whole lead for
  as long as that lasts, which is no reason to take its voice away.
  `server_voice_slow_test.py` reads two listeners (one seated, one spectating) at
  1500 B/s while a third player talks: the room keeps about 27 of its 30 ticks a
  second and neither falls more than ~25 ticks behind; without these rules the room
  runs at 2-8 ticks a second. Its `--case cpu` (ctest `server_voice_cpu`) seats a
  fast-link player who runs 22 ticks a second: he holds the room and hears every
  frame (judged by the processed tick he would hear none).

Per talker the server relays 60 frames / 16 KB a second and drops the
excess. An END marker skips those budgets so a cut-off transmission still
closes, but it carries no audio (audio or START with END fails the connection)
and only the one END owed to a transmission that relayed audio is passed on, so
ENDs can never outnumber relayed audio frames. 300 frames a second, a malformed
frame or a client sending `VoiceDown` fails that connection; 4,000 frames a second
across the server. `VoiceListen` is exempt from the lobby budgets shared by an
address, an account and the server (a dropped one would never be repeated), but
not from the connection's own (`LeaveGame` likewise: see
[Room scope](#room-scope-what-a-client-takes-and-when)). The client
(`client/voice.h`) captures and plays on SDL audio devices of its own, buffers
2–8 frames per talker, rebuilds a frame the server dropped from the next frame's
FEC, and conceals a late one. It sends while the push-to-talk key is held or,
under TALK MODE Voice Activation (client only, no wire message of its own), while
`voice::VoiceGate` (`client/voiceptt.h`) is open: a 20 ms frame whose peak
reaches ACTIVATION LEVEL opens it, it holds 20 frames (400 ms) after the last
such frame, and the 2 frames (40 ms) before it opened lead the transmission. It
mixes the talkers with each one scaled by that player's diplomacy **VOLUME**
slider (0-100 by player slot, 100 by default; humans other than yourself only,
none for an AI), then applies OUTPUT VOLUME and a soft limiter. The sliders are
local: never sent, hashed or recorded, reset to 100 each game, greyed while voice
chat is off. Opus is built from its pinned source release (`cmake/Opus.cmake`)
and linked only into takclient. Tests: `voice_test` (codec, jitter buffer,
push-to-talk, engine on SDL's disk audio driver, the VOICE CHAT page, the
per-player mix), `diplomacy_ui` (the VOLUME sliders), `voice_client_test`
(MpClient on the wire), `server_voice_test.py` (routing, budgets, abuse against a
real server), `server_voice_slow_test.py` (slow listeners do not hold up the
game), `conn_test` (the low-priority queue).

### Server hardening

- Frame-length cap (`kMaxFrame`, 256 KB): an oversized frame drops the
  connection.
- Per-player command cap (`kCmdCapPerTick`, 64 a tick, with a queue of
  `kCmdQueueCap` = 8 ticks' worth) so a spammer can't inflate every bundle for
  eight clients; excess commands are dropped with a notice. Explicit orders have
  limits of their own: 16,384 members (`kOrderMaxMembers`), 64 orders / 384 KiB
  outstanding per client, 96 KiB of order records per tick shared by the room
  (first pick rotating), the same per-second byte and command budgets (an order's
  members count as commands; over the command budget an order waits at the head
  of its client's queue, it is never dropped). An order in a Retail game fails
  the connection.
- Full validation of remote input: `Cmd` kind range, `type` strings looked up
  against the registry, unit/target ids sane. Malformed ⇒ disconnect.
- Lobby rate limits (CreateGame, Chat, ListGames floods), shared per address,
  per account and per server, besides each connection's own.
- Keepalive: the server pings a quiet client after 5 s and drops a silent
  connection after 15 s (outside the running-game disconnect wait of §4, which
  takes over for seated players). Load-bearing during pause, when no bundles
  flow. The allowance is 30 s for a seated client that is loading (from its
  `GameStarting` until its `Loaded`; `Client::loaded` is false in between),
  since the client loads on its main thread without reading the socket. The
  drop reason reads `timed out while loading (30 s)`.
- `--server <host>` resolves via `getaddrinfo` — IPv6 and hostnames.

## 6. Simulation: players and teams

1. **8 players.** `World` holds `kMaxPlayers` = 8 players, sized from game
   setup, with bounds guards on spawn. Each player's colour slot spans the 10
   retail palette variants — every player picks any of the 10 colors, and with
   8 players lobby-enforced uniqueness is always satisfiable.
2. **Team layer.** `Player::team` (0–7, set at game setup; default = player
   index) + `World::allied(a, b)`. Friend/foe tests use `allied()`: splash
   damage, target auto-acquire, auras, resurrect, cloak proximity, capture, and
   the viewer's attack-click/AI target scans. `owns()` stays per-player — allies
   cannot command each other's units. `team` is fixed for the game; making it
   mutable would need a sequenced event **and `team` in `stateHash`**.
3. **Shared team vision.** Every sim keeps the per-player sight plane (hashed);
   the client merges its team's planes into the display fog and draws allied
   units through it. Radar only marks the minimap, from the local player's own
   units. See `height-and-fog.md`.
4. **Win condition: last team standing — and defined defeat.** Per-team alive
   counts are computed **inside the sim**, so every sim (and the referee)
   concludes it independently on the same tick. A player is defeated when they
   have no living units; a *forfeited* player's units are disposed per the
   room's forfeit rule (inert or self-destruct). A defeated human stays in the
   game with their team's vision until it ends or they leave. A team is out when
   all its players are; the game ends when one team remains. Ally vision shrinks
   on defeat with no extra work — sight comes from living units.
5. **N-player spawn.** Map start positions (`.ota` `StartPosN` specials) are
   assigned to players per the START LOCATIONS rule (§13), with per-player
   faction kits and starting mana.
6. **Hash coverage.** `stateHash` covers veterancy, reload timers, god favor,
   projectiles (owner, quantized position) and order targets — counts alone
   hide same-count divergences, and fast attribution is the referee's whole job.

Gods do not appear in multiplayer: retail rolled a 10% chance that a game is
god-enabled (`gods.tdf GameChance=0.1`); ours deliberately does not
(`src/sim/matchsetup.cpp`).

## 7. Server AI (`src/ai/`)

One `ai::Controller` per AI player (`src/ai/ai.h`):

```cpp
namespace tak::ai {
  Profile loadProfile(const hpi::Vfs&, const std::string& name = "default");
  class Controller {
    Controller(int player, const sim::TypeRegistry&, const Profile&, uint32_t seed,
               Difficulty = Difficulty::Normal, std::vector<std::pair<float,float>> enemyStarts = {});
    // evaluated each sim tick; does nothing off its think cadence; emits net::Commands
  };
}
```

- **Commands, not mutations.** The AI changes the world only by emitting
  `Command`s through a sink — on the server they enter the sequencer like any
  client's. This also rules out server-only direct-mutation bugs that would make
  the referee itself desync (§4's suspicion rule is the backstop).
- **Sim-tick cadence.** The controller thinks every 30 sim ticks, never on wall
  clock, so it is replay-safe.
- **Seeded RNG.** The AI's private RNG is seeded per game + player (from
  `GameStarting`), so eight AIs don't mirror each other. AI RNG stays outside
  the sim.
- **World access** is const, under the memo-purity rule of §3.
- **Omniscience.** The AI's positional intel ignores fog (its economy is
  honest), as the retail-era AI did.

Single player runs these controllers on its private local server, like any
multiplayer game.

## 8. Client (`takclient`)

- **Server browser:** game list with name, map, players/capacity, lobby/running
  state, lock icon; CREATE asks only the game's name and password, then opens
  the room, where the host picks the map and options (§5, Room editing).
- **Room:** seat rows (name/AI/closed, faction, color swatch, team number, ready
  check, ping), chat, host controls (add AI, kick, close seat, change map, rules,
  start). Players edit their own row; the host edits any.
- **In-game:** allied units render through shared fog and show on the minimap;
  score/status panel for 8 players with team grouping; net status HUD (tick,
  ping, **behind-by indicator**, paused-by, the disconnect wait's
  `WAITING FOR <name> 27` countdowns and the own `RECONNECTING` line); chat
  overlay.
- `--server`, `--name` select a server from the command line (debug builds). LAN
  play = run `takserver` on any machine on the LAN, or a LOCAL SERVER from the
  menu.

## 9. Maps, capacity, colors (retail facts)

- Capacity comes from counting `StartPosN` specials in the map's `.ota` — not
  `numplayers`, which is list-valued ("2, 4, 6, 8") or empty. The room caps
  human+AI seats at that count (a MAP SCENARIO can widen it, §13).
- Retail ships 55 skirmish maps: 6 support 2 starts, 9×3, 22×4, 4×5, 5×6, and
  **9 maps support the full 8** (e.g. Angvir's Maze, Black Heart Jungle,
  Sewers of Elam). The 8-player cap matches this retail ceiling — no shipped
  map has more than 8 starts, so no synthetic spawn-point fallback is needed
  and every player count has real maps.
- 10 colors confirmed in the retail art (10-frame GAF color sequences
  throughout; the engine samples `playerColors_[10]`) — 8 players picking among
  10 colors means uniqueness never runs out of options.

## 10. Per-game simulation and threads

Each running room lazily starts its own persistent simulation worker. The main
network thread freezes commands and events for one tick, then polls for its
completion without waiting for other rooms. There is at most one tick in flight
per room. Completed bundles, replay history, checksums, and campaign results are
published by the network thread; workers never touch sockets or shared room
metadata. A slow tick does not hold up the network loop or another room's ticks,
although games still compete for CPU and memory bandwidth. Map startup and
replay file writes are synchronous work on the main thread.

The running-room limit (`--max-running-games`) bounds the number of simulation
workers. Each running game's simulation gets an equal share of the server's
`--sim-threads` total (`auto`, the default, is every CPU thread the server may
use; a count above that means all of them) for its internal jobs, the game's
worker thread included: the total divided by the running games, rounded down,
never fewer than 2 (1 only when the total is 1) and never more than 64
(`sim::SimPool::serverShare`, `kMaxThreads`). The share is recomputed as games
start and end and applied between ticks, on the game's own worker; a tick takes
the share of the moment it is submitted. The floor of 2 means a busy server can
run more simulation threads than it has CPUs. Debug builds' `TAK_SIM_WORKERS`
overrides `auto` only.

With `--sim-cpus` (a list such as `1,3,5-7`, or `auto`; the default `none` pins
nothing) each running game's threads are also pinned, one to a CPU: the game
takes the next `share` CPUs of the list in turn, its worker thread the first and
its pool's workers the rest, re-pinned the same way, between ticks, whenever the
turn or the share changes; a thread past the end of the list, or one whose CPU
the server may not use, is not pinned (the server says which listed CPUs it may
not use). On a system that does not let a program pin threads, `--sim-cpus` is
ignored with a warning. Thread counts and pinning are scheduling only: the
simulation and its hash are the same at any width.

A client that starts a local server hands the work out between the game and the
server from its SIMULATION THREADS setting (`SimPool::handOut`): the local
server gets its own part as `--sim-threads`, and, when the player's **Pin
simulation threads** is on, the CPUs of that hand-out the client did not take
as `--sim-cpus` (`none` while it is off, the default).

The `room_worker` regression checks independent progress with a blocked worker,
serial/worker/client checksum equivalence, replay-budget rejection, and worker
exception recovery. It runs without networking or retail assets.

## 11. Per-room game mods

The pack transfer messages, alongside map transfer, are
ModOffer/ModRequest/ModChunk/ModReady/ModError (the offer label is `"mods"`). The
host selects named immediate subfolders of `mods/game/`, and every immediate
subfolder of `mods/game/always_enabled/` is added (`MpClient::hostGameModPacks`);
files directly in `mods/`, `mods/game/` or `always_enabled/` are excluded, and
`always_enabled` itself is never a pack. An always-enabled pack hides an ordinary
pack whose name matches ignoring case (`hpi::modPacks`), so the names in the
package are unique and plain. A guest never adds its own always-enabled game
packs: it mounts the host's package alone. Selections are merged with the
always-enabled packs first, then the ticked ones, each in alphabetical order
(later layers win), into a bounded, SHA-256-addressed package (no cosmetic file
ever goes in it). Server and peers verify it before room readiness. Each
game-mods room owns its own VFS and registries, leaving other rooms unchanged.
The server takes a package only from the host of a skirmish room with game mods
on: an offer or chunk from a guest or in a campaign room, and an offer while game
mods are off, are answered with ModError. The replay header records the shared
package digest (`ReplayHeader::modDigest`) and the `gameMods` byte, and playback
loads the package from `ModCache/` (in the per-user folder, `hpi::userMapRoot`;
never the game data folder). The room's game-mod ticks are part of the
remembered room settings, kept separately for single player and multiplayer.

The package also carries a pack's `ai/takengine.txt` (loose in the pack's `ai/`
folder or under `ai/` in an archive in it), and a map package carries it when
the map's own archive (its `.kmp`) has it (`maps::build`, checked on decode). The
server reads the room's one file, from the game-mod package, else from the map
package, and each of its AI levels 0-5 applies it over that level's own built-in
profile table (`src/ai/builtinprofile.h`). No other file name in `ai/` is read
for them. A root `takengine.txt` is not read, cosmetic packs can never supply
`ai/` files, and the base install's `ai/` folder is never consulted for these
names. Classic reads the map's `ai/<aiprofile>.txt` / `ai/default.txt` with the
same rule for `ai/` files: game mods, else the map package, else the base data
(`ai::classicProfileScript` with the room's layers); other map content keeps the
view's map-over-mod layering.

## 12. Match pathfinding selection

The host's choice is `Retail` (the default) or `Legion`. Game options and
every lobby/start/spectate snapshot carry it. The server validates the value,
adopts it from the host's option updates in a skirmish or Benchmark lobby and
keeps it once the game runs; both clients and the referee apply it through
shared match setup. Campaign missions are always Retail, and
campaign playback forces Retail whatever a header supplies. The host sets it
among the room's rules; every other client shows it read-only.

The wire byte, the replay header and the saved room settings' `pathfindingMode` use
the identities `0=Retail` and `4=Legion`; `1`, `2` and `3` name no mode. A
missing or unknown saved value loads as Retail, while an unknown network or
replay mode byte is rejected. Legion's groups and per-unit state are part of the
simulation checksum only in mode 4. A Legion client sends each click as one
explicit selection order (`Cmd::Order` in the tick bundles, carried up by the
OrderBegin/OrderMembers/OrderCommit/OrderAbort transaction); Retail clients, the
AI and scripts send per-unit commands. Debug-only `TAK_LEGION=1` selects Legion
in the headless multiplayer test harness, and `crowdbench` accepts `--mode
retail` or `legion` for direct comparisons. How Legion works:
[legion-pathfinding.md](legion-pathfinding.md).

## 13. Room options

`GameOptions` is 19 bytes on the wire, in this order: crusades,
forfeitSelfDestruct, gameMods, speed, speedUnlock, unitCap (u32),
monarchExpendable, stressTest, fogExplored, benchmark, randomStarts,
doubleSight, the pathfinding mode, allowSpectators, mapScenario and powerCodes.
`CreateGame`, `SetGameOptions`, `LobbyState` and `GameStarting` carry it, and
each `GameList` entry ends with the room's allowSpectators byte. In a running
game `SetGameOptions` adopts only speed.

- **ALLOW SPECTATORS** (`allowSpectators`, default 1). With it off the server
  answers every `Spectate` with a failed `JoinResult` ("spectators are not
  allowed in this game"). `Spectate` is the only way into a room without a slot,
  so this one check covers the browser's watch request, a seated player who left
  and asks to watch, and a dropped watcher reconnecting (watchers hold no resume
  token, and `Rejoin` seats only seated players). The host changes the rule in
  the lobby; it is fixed at start, so an admitted watcher is never stranded. A
  host who created the room to watch it is never removed by the rule. The client
  keeps a refusal's reason for the browser (`MpClient::joinError`) and clears the
  pending spectate on any refusal. A watcher sees the whole map, with no fog and
  no control.
- **MAP SCENARIO** (`mapScenario`, default 0; in the lobby it changes only with the
  map, through `SetRoomMap`). With it on, shared
  match setup plays the map's own scenario -- the `.crt` placements and rules
  and the Use Only `.tdf` -- as for a Cartographer Test Map copy, except that a
  Use Only entry no unit type answers to is left out rather than refused (maps
  made for the original game name such units; NeverGlory names 44). Setup runs
  the scenario when the map's `.ota` carries the Test Map opt-in
  (`[TAKPlaytest] authoredscenario=1`) or when the option is on and the `.ota`
  declares `hasscenario`. `SetGameOptions` never changes it: the capacity it
  implies sizes the room's open seats (a scenario can need seats past the map's
  start positions), so it changes with the map's capacity in one `SetRoomMap`,
  which moves seats as a map change does. The server clears it
  for campaign missions, generated maps, stress tests and benchmarks, and forces
  Start Locations to FIXED with it. At START it reads the verified package's own
  files (`maps::scenarioInfo` over the package, never the host's claim): it
  refuses a room whose map has no scenario content ("this map has no scenario
  to play"), refuses while a seat the scenario needs is empty ("Seat player N in
  the lobby to play this scenario"), and refuses a package that leaves out a
  scenario file setupMatch will read: the `.crt` of a declared scenario, or the
  named Use Only list ("the map package leaves out its Use Only list"), since
  setupMatch would otherwise read each machine's own copy, which no digest
  covers. A start refusal reaches the host as `MapError` and the client shows it
  in the room (`MpClient::startError`). The seats a scenario needs are its
  placement owners 0-7 and every Player N rule bank with a group that has a
  condition or an action. The option is sim-affecting and recorded in the replay
  header.
- **START LOCATIONS** (`randomStarts`): 0 FIXED, 1 RANDOM, 2 BY SLOT
  (`net::kStartsBySlot`): slot N takes the map's Nth start whichever seats are
  empty, and a seated slot past the map's last start takes the lowest start no
  seated slot claims by its own number, then a spot near the map centre
  (`sim::startSpotsFor`). Any other nonzero value reads as RANDOM
  (`normalizeStartMode`). Under FIXED and RANDOM a seat picks no start, so the
  room's MOVE HERE is greyed unless a map scenario's seats have armies or rules
  of their own.
- **POWER CODES** (`powerCodes`, default 0, set by the host in a skirmish lobby,
  fixed once the game runs, forced off in campaigns). `Cmd::PowerCode` carries one of the
  seven simulation codes (`targetId` the code, `queue` the +LOS argument,
  `unitId` the +ManaMe unit); the server drops it while the room's option is
  off and treats an unknown code or argument as a forgery.
- **FOG OF WAR** (`fogExplored`, 0..2) is display for every client, and
  sim-affecting for area clear only (`MatchConfig::roomMapRevealed` /
  `roomLosOff`, `World::setRoomVision`: retail's explored allowance reads the
  Mapping plane, which Map Revealed fills).
- **Benchmark** rooms run the spawn ramp on the server's wall clock: the server
  adds `Cmd::BenchClock` to a tick's bundle whenever more of the ramp's stages
  are due (`targetId`, out of `benchmarkSpawns(level)` spread over 60 real
  seconds from the first tick) and once more when the 60 seconds are up
  (`queue` = 1); every sim fires the due stages in order and ends the run on it,
  and a replay reproduces it from the recorded commands. A client never sends
  `BenchClock` (its parser refuses the kind). A benchmark room may run at
  `kMaxBenchmarkGameSpeed` (110, +100).

## 14. Commands

`BuildManaArea` carries a builder, lodestone type, queue flag and two rectangle
corners in 43 bytes, like area reclaim; every other command keeps the 35-byte
layout. Every peer executes one persistent area mission, exploring deposits
before trying normal clearing, placement, construction and upgrades; its cursor
and exploration stage are hashed. An order verb's `queue` byte carries
`kQueueFront` (Ctrl: the order goes in at the head without clearing the queue)
and the `kQueueToggle` bit (a player's own Shift or Ctrl click takes back a
queued order of the same kind on its target or within 16 px of its point); a
producer's rally list takes both. Fire at a point arrives as `Cmd::AttackGround`.
Builders on patrol repair nearby units automatically (`MatchConfig::patrolRepairs`).
Defensive AI interception is server-local policy; its ordinary movement commands
are sequenced and recorded as usual.

## 15. Versions and replays

Peers, the server and replays must all match `kNetVersion` (323) exactly: the
handshake refuses a peer of any other protocol, and a replay plays only under the
replay format and protocol that recorded it (`supportedReplayProtocol`,
`src/net/replayhdr.h`). The loader reads the current format (`kReplayFormat` =
15) and refuses any other format or protocol, and a strict bundle read accepts
every current command kind and event kinds 1, 2 and 4 (3 is reserved). There
are no compatibility variants of the simulation. The replay header records,
beside the map, slots and seed, the pathfinding mode, the MAP SCENARIO byte, the
POWER CODES byte (bit 0 the option, bit 1 the map started revealed: FOG OF WAR
Explored or Full Vision, which +Mapping starts from), the FOG OF WAR byte, and
the `gameMods` byte with the shared package's `modDigest`. The
[CHANGELOG](../CHANGELOG.md) lists each release's protocol and replay format.

## 16. Testing

- **Headless clients** (`TAK_HEADLESS=1 takclient game ... --mpai`, debug
  builds) let CI run scripted clients + a server on one machine and assert every
  hash matches to game end; `takserver --seed` makes the hash repeatable.
- **Replay determinism:** a game's log re-run must reproduce the final hash —
  this also guards AI determinism.
- **Fault injection:** socket kill, delayed delivery, malformed/oversized
  frames, command floods, and a deliberately desynced client (mutated unit
  hp) must produce: referee flags exactly that client, the disconnect wait and
  takeover follow, the game completes. A deliberately desynced *referee* (test
  hook) must trigger the suspicion rule, not a mass drop. `server_disconnect`
  and `disconnect_client` cover the disconnect wait, holds, rejoin and takeover.
- `fp_contract`, `room_worker`, the voice tests (§5) and
  `tools/room_flow_test.py` (the room, scripted through `TAK_ROOM_SCRIPT`) run in
  ctest.
- `tools/desync-hunt-remote.sh`: `--minutes` limits simulated match time;
  `TAK_WALL_TIMEOUT=3600` grants each client up to one real hour for a dense
  stress run (the default is simulated seconds plus 300). The same tick,
  completion and hash checks apply. `--only` retains each scenario's full-table
  seed so targeted retries reproduce its original map/start seed.
- The `--shot`/`--time` smoke harness covers the offline client paths.
