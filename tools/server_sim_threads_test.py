"""takserver --sim-threads <auto|N>: how many CPU threads the running games' referee simulations share.

The command line, on the binary alone (no game data): `auto` and a count from 1 are accepted
(the next refusal is then about something else), 0, a negative number and junk are refused with
the option's own usage error, a missing value with the generic one, and --help lists the option.

With --data, on real servers: the total S is every CPU thread the server may use by default
(`auto`), or the count asked for (one above the usable threads means all of them). Each running
game gets S divided by the running games, rounded down, but at least 2 (1 when S is 1) and at
most 64, and the server logs that share when a game starts and whenever it changes as games
start and end. The option is scheduling only: with --seed, the game it starts has the same seed
either way.

--sim-cpus <list|auto|none> pins those threads: `none` (the default), `auto` and a list of CPU
numbers and ranges are accepted, anything else is refused with its usage error. A server that
pins nothing logs the lines above; one given a list hands each running game the next CPUs of it,
one per thread, and its lines name them (`pinned to cpus 4,5 / 6,7`), with `none` for a game past
the end of the list and the count of threads left unpinned.
