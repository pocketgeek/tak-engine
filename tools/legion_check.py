          bound  an absolute declared bound (`per: unit` divides by the units)
  phase_gate  (cumulative combat keys only; lead ruling W4 (p)) the key's value at each of >= 10 stripe
          phases of a phase-sensitive change: the cumulative combat check passes a value above `w0` when
          the MEDIAN of the phases is at or below `w0` and the value is within the recorded range
  Time keys (.t50 .t90 .done .orders_done): -1 reads "never" = infinitely bad.
  KEYs: observer / work.* keys of the runner's "keys", `hash@OFFSET`, and
        `serial_eq_workers`.

Offsets (lead rulings W3 round 3, 2026-10-09): a run on the gate offsets (0,+-1..+-5, or a file's
`gateoffsets`; `legion_scenario --offsets gate`, the default of --check) is re-read here: the
small-count keys (crossings, wall touch, the t90 of a group under 10 bodies) on the median of all
its offsets, every other key on the core five 0,+-1,+-2. contact_settled's Retail floor is read
only where both modes deliver >= 10 units, and an offset-spread exception is never a floor
exception.

Click level (lead ruling W3 final exit (f)): a one-body observer group whose click one convoy
merged with others (aware-*, motion-*; the runner reports `g.G.click_n` for it and the convoy's
`click.C.n/arrived/t50/t90/done`) is judged at click level in both modes: its own arrived / t50 /
t90 / done are report-only (no entry, no band, no Retail floor); the click's keys carry them.
`apply_ratchet` keeps the offset spread a cleared Retail-floor exception had masked: it is
converted to a spread exception (ruling (h)).

Per-file lane crossings (user decision W8-1, 2026-10-10): for the GAP fixtures (`gap*`: gap6 .. gap20,
gapsweep) the Retail floor of `gate.X.crossings` compares legion crossings / files abreast with Retail's
crossings / files abreast (`gate.X.files_x100`, a mean under 1 read as 1), because the passage gate takes
a gap two or three abreast where Retail single-files. Corner and head-on fixtures keep the raw count.

W9-U1 (user, 2026-10-10): where Retail itself is 0 or 1, x1.1 of it is 0 or 1.1, below Retail's own spread
(0..10 on corner crossings, ruling (a)), so three keys are judged on the eleven-offset median with a
one-event tolerance, `legion <= max(retail x1.1, retail + 1)`: corner-1x448 `gate.top.crossings`,
tail-corner380 `wall_touch_near_permille`, and the GAP fixtures' per-file crossing key
(`gate.X.crossings_per_file_x100`, below). Every other Retail-floor key keeps legion <= retail x1.1.

The gap per-file key (W9 step 0, W8-1): for a GAP fixture `regate` derives `gate.X.crossings_per_file_x100` =
crossings x 10000 / max(100, files_x100) at EACH offset and takes the median of the eleven, the number the
W8-1 rule compares (a ratio of the per-offset medians used to stand in for it); the floor reads it, an INFO
line prints it for every GAP fixture, and it is a plain key for the exit table.

Precedence (PLAN 3.0): eq/safety, then the Retail floor, then a declared
tolerance or accepted regression, then the bands. A tolerance never licenses a
Retail-floor failure; one with a `step` licenses its loss only when `--step`
names that step, and only up to its `max` (absolute) or `factor` (x the base).
