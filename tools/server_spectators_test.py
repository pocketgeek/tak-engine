"""ALLOW SPECTATORS on a real server: the host's room rule, enforced by the server.

Each scenario runs on its own and every failure is reported, so a server without
the Spectate check shows exactly which admission paths it leaves open:

  allowed       ON (the default): the game list says so and a WATCH gets the stream
  refused       OFF: a WATCH is refused with the reason, and the in-game options
                message cannot turn it back on (fixed once the game starts)
  reconnect     OFF: a dropped player's new connection cannot come back as a
                watcher, while its seated Rejoin still works
  switch        OFF: a seated player who leaves the running game cannot watch it
  lobby toggle  the host flips it in the lobby; the last value is what the game
                starts with and what the list reports
  host only     a seated non-host cannot change it; when the host leaves the lobby
                the rule stays with the room and the new host may change it
  host watcher  OFF with the host watching its all-AI room: the host keeps its
                seat (the rule governs who ELSE may watch), outsiders are refused
