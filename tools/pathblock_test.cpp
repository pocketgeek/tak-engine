// pathblock_test -- a unit must get PAST other units standing in its way.
//
// Reported as "they don't go around larger obstacles, they try their damndest to go
// over or through them first". Terrain was only half of it. The other half was other
// units, and it had two causes that had to be fixed together -- fixing either alone
// leaves the unit stuck, which is why this test exists rather than a comment.
//
// ONE: the SEARCH routed through them. cellScore grades a parked body kCellOccupied,
// which EQUALS kCellThreshold, so it is passable-but-costly -- retail's model, where
// every icd call site compares against 4. Our mover has no local avoidance and bodies
// are solid, so a route through a standing crowd is a route into a wall.
//
// TWO: the route SHORTCUT straightened it back through them. Once the search goes
// around, a shortcut that only checks terrain undoes the detour.
//
// Measured on the wall below before the fix: every thickness from 1 to 8 cells STUCK,
// and it stayed stuck with the shortcut disabled entirely -- which is how the first
// diagnosis (blame the shortcut) was shown to be wrong. After: every thickness passes,
// travelling 1262-1329 against a 1100 straight line.
