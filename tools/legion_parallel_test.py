"""legion_parallel_test -- stage 9's parallel planning decides nothing (Legion 10,000 stage 9, brief phase 8).

    legion_parallel_test.py LEGION_SCENARIO SCALE_DIR [--data DIR] [--quick]

Legion builds chain tiles as asynchronous jobs beside its serial field pass, and the cell layer of a plane's first
build in row chunks, on the SimPool (src/sim/legion.cpp tilePrefetch, computeRows). Both are exact by construction:
the jobs and their logical budgets are chosen from sim state before any job runs, each job reads immutable inputs of
its own and writes only its own slot, and the serial pass consumes the results by exact key, in its own order,
waiting for a job still running -- so the state hash and every observer key must equal the run without any of it,
whatever the worker count and whatever order the jobs finish in. Per fixture this runs:

  * the reference: --serial (no SimPool workers: nothing is built ahead, every tile is built in the serial pass);
  * --workers with TAK_SIM_WORKERS = 1, 3 and 7;
  * --workers with 3 and 7 workers and --par-perturb SEED (the jobs run in a shuffled order with random delays,
    so they complete in a different order on every run);
  * --serial --par-force --par-perturb SEED under TAK_LEGION_VERIFY (the jobs inline, shuffled; every staged tile
    the serial pass takes is rebuilt there and compared, and every derived index is checked each tick);

and checks: every run exits 0; every run's state hash and observer keys equal the reference's; and the parallel
paths really ran (NAVPAR on stderr): over the set, tiles were staged and taken (chains), and plane rows were built
in chunks. A run whose path ran nothing would prove nothing.

Exit 0 pass, 1 fail, 2 tooling, 77 skipped (no game data).
