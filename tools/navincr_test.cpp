// navincr_test -- the incremental component update must be INDISTINGUISHABLE from a
// full relabel.
//
// blockCells() carries a cached component labelling across a pure-block edit when it can
// prove locally that nothing was severed (World::tryIncrementalBlock). That is a
// performance shortcut on a structure the deterministic sim reads: pathExists() decides
// whether an order is reachable, so a labelling that disagrees with the truth by even one
// cell is a DESYNC, not a slow frame. This test exists to make that impossible to ship
// quietly.
//
// Method: two worlds, identical terrain, identical block sequences. The WARM world is
// queried between every edit, so its cache is live and the incremental path runs on each
// block. The COLD world is queried only at the end, so its cache is built once, from
// scratch, against the final obstacle set. Their answers must agree on every pair.
//
// The generated walls deliberately include ones that SEVER the map (the fast path must
// refuse those and fall back) as well as ones that merely dent it.
