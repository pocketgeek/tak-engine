"""The game room end to end, driven through its own buttons by TAK_ROOM_SCRIPT.

Each case runs the real debug client (a single-player one starts its own takserver, which
logs to the same stream) on a scratch profile with its own settings file, gives it a
TAK_ROOM_SCRIPT -- room actions, each through the member its button calls, each ended by its
own test within its limit -- and reads the log: the client prints "room script: <step>:
done" per step and "room script: finished", and the server its room lines. A script that
cannot finish prints why and ends the client. TAK_QUIT_TICK ends a game that started.

  1  single player (CLI game room): an AI seated, CHANGE MAP to Inner Circle, START; the
     game plays to the quit tick.
  2  single player WATCH: the host leaves its seat, AIs fill the room, START; the host plays
     the game as a spectator.
  3  CHANGE MAP to a 6-player random map, four AIs seated, then a 2-player one: the server
     removes the three AIs past its seats, and the game on it starts.
  4  multiplayer unready: a guest READY, the host changes FOG OF WAR, the server clears the
     guest's READY (the guest is told so), the guest readies again and the host STARTs.
  5  PLAY THE MACHINE (the menu's door): the room opens at once from the single-player
     settings; an AI, CHANGE MAP and CRUSADES are remembered in spRoom.* (mpRoom.* untouched),
     and the next launch's room opens on that map with those rules.
  6  --play-map: the room opens on the Test Map copy and keeps it (CHANGE MAP is refused
     here), starts with one AI and no second human, and writes no remembered map.
  7  a remembered map that is not installed: the room opens on the launch's map (athri cay)
     instead, and says why.
  8  LOCAL SERVER host: the room opens at once as "<name>'s Game" with the CONNECT password,
     which its line shows on SHOW; LEAVE closes the game and goes back to CONNECT TO SERVER.
  9  online CREATE: the window's default makes a room "<account>'s Game" from the multiplayer
     settings; a rule change is remembered in mpRoom.* (spRoom.* untouched).
  10 single player MAP SCENARIO confirm: on a map whose scenario seats more players than it
     has starts, turning the scenario off would remove AIs, so the first click only arms the
     cell (the note says what the next does); the second removes them, and the room says so.
  11 the CREATE window and the password window: CREATE with a name and a password opens that
     room, locked; a second player's game list has it locked (its row asks the password), a
     wrong password is refused in the window, which stays open (its SHOW is pressed there),
     and the right one, sent from the same window, gets in; the room's password starts
     hidden for the host and for the guest, SHOW shows it, and it is hidden again in the
     room entered next (the guest leaves and joins again). No log has either password: the
     clients say only which way SHOW / HIDE went, and the server nothing.
  12 create, SHOW, LEAVE in quick succession, many times: the tables the server sent before
     it took each LEAVE arrive after it, and the client never ends in a room again (it used
     to reopen the room the server had just dissolved). Each round ends with the game list
     held for a moment (browser:<ms>, which fails in a room).
  13 CREATE on a server at its game limit (--max-games 1, one game open): the CREATE window
     says CANNOT OPEN A GAME: server game capacity reached and stays open, and the
     connection is kept: the same client then joins the game that is there.
  14 START on a server at its running-game limit (--max-running-games 1, another player's
     game running; the room's guest is a scripted peer): the room says CANNOT START: server
     running-game capacity reached; retry later, stays open and still takes its host's
     changes.

Debug builds only (TAK_ROOM_SCRIPT, TAK_QUIT_TICK and the CLI game are debug hooks).
