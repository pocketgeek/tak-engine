# Cross-build determinism check for the simulation's deterministic math shim.
# See docs/detmath-scope.md. Two parts:
#
#   1. Guard  -- the sim path must not call libm transcendentals directly
#      (they are not correctly-rounded and would break cross-build lockstep).
#   2. Golden -- build the detmath shim standalone with every available
#      compiler x optimization level (and aarch64 under qemu when present) and
#      assert every build emits the SAME golden hash.
#
# A leg is SKIPPED (not failed) when its toolchain is absent, so this runs
# anywhere. In CI, install clang + g++-aarch64-linux-gnu + qemu-user-static so
# all three legs (second compiler, cross-arch) actually run. Exits non-zero if
# the guard trips or any two builds disagree.
