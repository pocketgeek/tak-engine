# COMMENTS ARE STRIPPED FIRST. The guard matches raw text, so a comment that merely
# DESCRIBES the rule trips it -- which is not hypothetical in a codebase that documents
# its math this heavily: "a computed ring (cx + cos(a)*radius)" took CI red on a commit
# that touched no arithmetic at all. Stripping keeps line numbers (the comment body is
# blanked, the line stays), so reported positions still point at real code.
#
# Both comment forms are handled, and stripping is deliberately conservative: anything
# it cannot classify stays IN the text and is still matched. A guard that fails open
# would be worse than the false positive it replaces.
