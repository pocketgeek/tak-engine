"""Room editing on a real server (protocol 323): the host changes the room's rules, seats,
map, name and password in the lobby, and every change but the name, the password, the
speed and the host's own READY unreadies the ready guests.

Each case runs on its own and every failure is reported:

  options     SetGameOptions bumps the room's revision (changeBits options) and unreadies
              the guest, the host's READY kept; ALLOW SPECTATORS bumps, speed alone does
              not; unit limit, pathfinder and POWER CODES are adopted in the lobby, MAP
              SCENARIO is not; a mission room adopts only speed and ALLOW SPECTATORS
  stale       a guest's READY on an older revision is stored as not ready, on the
              current one as ready; the host's own is never revision-checked
  join rev    a joiner readies with its JoinResult's revision, before any LobbyState
  slots       the host seating an AI or changing its own team bumps (changeBits players);
              the host never readies a guest; a guest's own edit bumps nothing; a KICK bumps
  join ready  a seat a READY guest left is not ready for the next player
  info        SetRoomInfo renames and locks the room without a bump; GameList follows; the
              password is enforced; a guest's request is ignored; a bad name is refused
              (RoomError); a successor's rename keeps the password it never knew
  create      an empty name is "<name>'s Game" (at most 32 bytes); a name past 32 bytes
              is refused with JoinResult(0) and the connection stays; the log names the
              map and the rules
  shrink      a smaller map moves a human down (JoinResult), removes the AI past it,
              closes the seats past it; GameList shows the capacity; the log line
  grow        a larger map opens the seats up to its capacity
  scenario    MAP SCENARIO off restores the host's start mode in the same change
  refusals    more humans than starts and an unknown recipe are refused (RoomError, then
              a LobbyState with the serial); a guest's request, an old serial and a
              Benchmark room are ignored; an unchanged map is answered to the host alone
  watch       the host leaves its seat to watch (JoinResult 0xFF) and sits again; a
              guest's watch and one in a mission room are ignored; a room started with
              the host watching gives it 0xFF; a running room ignores SetRoomMap
  mods+map    a game-mod offer, a map change and the new map's offer back to back: the
              room still reaches maps ready (the mod validation survives the map change)
  budget      lobby work is charged by kind: 100 ListGames back to back keep the connection
              (cost 1 each); 40 SetRoomMaps (cost 4 each) pass the 128 a second and drop it
  clients     map_transfer_test --room-edit: map changes between real MpClients (downloads,
              flips, changes during an upload, START races); no upload deadline in the log
