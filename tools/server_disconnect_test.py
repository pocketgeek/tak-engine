"""The disconnect wait (protocol 289) on a real server, at protocol level.

Two seated players on a generated map; the server runs with a short stall threshold and
wait (TAK_STALL_MS / TAK_DROP_WAIT_MS) so nothing here waits the real 30 s:

  takeover   Bob goes silent: Alice is told the room is WAITING for him with a countdown,
             no tick closes during it, and when it runs out a bundle carries
             Event::AiTakeover for his seat, the game goes on and his seat issues
             commands (the server's Normal AI). His connection is closed, and a late
             reconnect is told an AI has the seat.
  resume     Bob goes silent past the stall threshold and talks again inside the wait:
             the wait ends, nobody is taken over, and both receive the same bundles.
  reconnect  Bob's connection closes without a Leave: the room waits at once; a new
             connection's Rejoin (token + the first tick it lacks) is Reseated and
             streamed the bundles from exactly that tick, identical to Alice's; the old
             token is spent.
  leave      an explicit LeaveGame is a Leave event at once, with no wait.
  budget     the wait is a budget per seat per game, charged in whole seconds: Bob back
             1.2 s into his first wait has spent 2 s of the 3, so his second wait counts
             down from 1 s (his own client is told so) and he is taken over when it
             runs out, not 3 s later.
  spent      Bob back in the last second of his wait has spent it all: his next stall
             is taken over at once, without the room waiting for him.
