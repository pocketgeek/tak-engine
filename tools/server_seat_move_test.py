"""Msg::MoveSeat on a real server: a seated player takes another OPEN seat.

Under START LOCATIONS: BY SLOT the seat is the start position (and under FIXED the
seat order decides it), so this is how a human picks where they open. Checked:

  host move     the host leaves slot 1 for slot 3: JoinResult names the new seat, the
                table shows it there with its side and colour, and slot 1 is open
  joiner        a second client joins into the opened seat and sees the host's move
  refused       an occupied, AI, closed, past-capacity, out-of-range or own seat is
                ignored -- no JoinResult, no table, for either client
  player move   a non-host moves; the host's table shows the old seat open
  running       once the game runs a move is ignored
