"""takclient's RESTART NOW for a new GAME DATA FOLDER, end to end (POSIX exec).

The debug menu pick TAK_MENU_PICK=restart:<folder> does what Options does on a valid
pick and RESTART NOW: saves the folder to the settings file and leaves the menu. main()
then tears down and execs itself with the same arguments. The new process must mount
the NEW folder (it was started without --data, from a folder that is not an install, so
the saved setting decides) and must not restart again. The profile is a scratch
XDG_* tree, never the player's settings.

usage: client_restart_test.py <takclient> <retail-install>
