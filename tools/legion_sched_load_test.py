"""legion_sched_load_test -- the field scheduler under continuous load (Legion 10,000 stage 4).

    legion_sched_load_test.py LEGION_SCENARIO SCN [--budget-div N] [--field-bytes N] [--ticks N]

Runs SCN in Legion, serial and workers, and checks SERVICE, not throughput. In every run: serial == workers,
and the builds in flight never exceed the windows they can be served in (scale.sched.inflight_max.first <=
kFirstInflight, .refresh <= kRefreshInflight; e.g. battle-assault.scn, where a per-class count let 40 first
builds into flight). The rest depends on the file:

tools/scenarios/scale/sched-load.scn (48 squads re-clicked to far tiles every 160 ticks and a rock walking
across the map, so field requests arrive faster than the quota serves them for the whole run):

  * serial == workers (the runner fails on any state or key mismatch);
  * the field quota really was saturated (the longest run of fully spent ticks), so the bounds below are
    measured under load;
  * every service class's longest gap between two slices of work for a job that asked for work
    (scale.sched.gap_max.*) within 3 x kAgeStep (age promotion to the top class) + one round-robin rotation of
    the largest possible top class (1,024 fields of kSlice each over the quota): 539 ticks;
  * every class's longest start-request wait (scale.sched.age_max.*) within the promotion time, the
    reservation age and one field tenure: 900 ticks (memory never runs short here: the quota is the limit);
  * no body waits longer than 60 ticks for a usable field (scale.wait.max, the frozen scale target);
  * movement goes on: most bodies arrive somewhere over the run (scale.moving.peak, scale.arrive.n > 0).
  With --budget-div N the registration, plane-build and awareness budgets are divided (over-budget paths);
  the service bounds still hold, and the run must really defer registrations and wait for plane builds
  (scale.sched.reg_deferred, plane_waits > 0).

A file with `navbytes`, or any file run with --field-bytes (tools/scenarios/scale/sched-mix.scn: a field
allowance of two whole-map fields, short-hop squads re-clicked every 120 ticks round squads crossing the map;
many-1000.scn --field-bytes 778752 --ticks 3000): memory, not the quota, is the limit, and large requests
compete with a stream of small ones. Checks:

  * the memory-pressure mechanisms ran in the sim: capacity refusals stepped over (fit_skips), reservations,
    request age promotion (and, unless --ticks shortens the run, shares admitted behind a stopped scan);
  * admission liveness: no run of consecutive ticks with a refusal for room and no new build longer than
    kFieldTenure + kStillScan + the longest build (below) -- every finished field, shared ones included, is a
    victim one tenure after it starts (scale.sched.admit_gap_max; many-1000 at two maps froze for ~1,800
    ticks when shared fields were never victims);
  * every class's longest start-request wait within a bound DERIVED FROM CAPACITY:

        steps(class) x kAgeStep + kReserveAge + rounds x (kFieldTenure + kStillScan)
        rounds = ceil(4 x request_cells_max / (A - 4 W H))

    A = the allowance (navbytes), 4 W H = one whole-map field (the largest request), request_cells_max = the
    most cells the start requests listed in one tick needed together (measured: the queue, in memory).
    Why: requests are served oldest first (a lower class rises one class per kAgeStep, steps(class) to the
    top); a request refused for room reserves after kReserveAge, and from then on nothing takes new room
    before it (shares take none). Every finished field is a victim kFieldTenure after it started (a share
    lands within kStillScan of the start, so sharing extends that by no more), so within one "round" of
    kFieldTenure + kStillScan ticks all the memory held at its start can be freed, which admits at least
    A - 4 W H of the queue's cells. That needs every build to finish within its tenure, checked from the
    file: kFirstInflight whole-map builds (8 W H relaxations + W H / kInitDiv initialisation each) at half
    the quota (the other half may pay plane debt) take at most kFieldTenure ticks.
    On sched-mix the bound fails if the reservation is removed (the large requests starve: 4,497 ticks) or
    requests are served by id instead of age (4,604), both measured (docs/legion-10000-progress.md, 7.4).
  * movement goes on (scale.arrive.n > 0).
