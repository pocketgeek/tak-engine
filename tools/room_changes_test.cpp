//  - each kind of change: the map, MAP SCENARIO, one rule, several rules, the players, the
//    game mods, the name (no revision: a rename unreadies nobody), the password (no note)
//  - " -- READY AGAIN" only when the guest's READY was cleared by a new revision
//  - AIs removed by a smaller map, told apart from seats the host closed by hand
//  - the player the server moved down, told apart from a MoveSeat of its own
//  - the host's own changes: no rule notes, only the seats a smaller map took and the
//    guests it must wait for again
