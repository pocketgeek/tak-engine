# desync-hunt.sh -- long-running 8-AI games across many setting combinations, in
# parallel, looking for one thing: a client whose state hash stops matching the
# server's referee.
#
# WHY THIS SHAPE. A desync needs three things to surface: enough SIM SURFACE that
# divergent code actually runs (8 AIs fighting exercise production, combat, pathing,
# gods, reclaim, transports), enough TIME that a rare divergence has a chance to
# happen, and enough SETTING VARIETY that option-gated code paths are covered. The
# usual 60s two-unit smoke run has none of those, which is why it reported a clean
# hash right through the god-summoning desync.
#
# HOW A DESYNC IS DETECTED. The server refs its own sim and compares every client's
# reported hash against it (Server::checkHashes), logging "client N DESYNCED at tick
# T". That comparison only happens when a HUMAN SLOT IS SEATED -- checkHashes returns
# on entry when `live == 0`, and a spectator sends a zero hash by design -- so every
# run here seats the client as a player (7 AIs + 1 human). An all-spectator sweep
# reports "no desyncs" having compared nothing at all. "REFEREE SUSPECT" is the opposite finding -- every client agrees and the SERVER
# is the odd one out. Both are failures here and both are grepped for; a run that
# ends any way other than cleanly is also reported, because a crash or a dropped
# connection hides whatever it was about to tell us.
#
# Each combination gets its own server on its own port and its own log pair, so runs
# are independent and can be read after the fact.

# One line per combination: NAME then the env/flags that define it. Chosen to cover
# the option-gated paths rather than to enumerate the full cross product, which would
# be thousands of runs: each line turns on something that has its own sim code.
#
# Maps are varied too -- Ulasem is roomy (placement never caps), Inner Circle is
# cramped (it does), and the water maps exercise transports and naval pathing.
# Every run is cadenced at 4x (TAK_SPEED=40) unless it overrides it. The harness is
# WALL-CLOCK paced, not CPU bound -- a 24-core box sat at 0.68 load running one game --
# so the limit on how much game time a hunt covers is the clock, not the machine.
# Speed re-cadences how fast ticks are ISSUED; the per-tick dt is fixed and the sim is
# bit-identical either way, so this buys 4x the coverage for nothing. One run below
# deliberately stays at 1x as a control, in case the cadence itself ever matters.
SPEED_DEFAULT="TAK_SPEED=40"

# MONARCH EXPENDABLE BY DEFAULT, to buy back some of the sweep's lost game time.
# With it off (the wire default) losing your Monarch loses the game, and 14 of 30 runs
# concluded before the clock at a mean of 8,760 ticks against the 36,000 they were given.
# The time lost is the valuable kind: a game that ends early never reaches the late-game
# state where armies are large and the map is built out, which is where the nav stalls
# lived and where a desync is likeliest to hide.
#
# WHAT IT ACTUALLY BUYS, measured by running the whole sweep both ways (29 comparable
# cases, same seeds): 662,663 -> 708,297 ticks, +6.9%. Ten runs got longer, fifteen were
# unchanged, and FOUR got SHORTER. Most of the gain is two cases that stopped finishing
# early at all -- cramped-stress 6,372 -> 36,000 and overrides-cosmetic 14,344 -> 36,000
# -- which is the late-game coverage worth having.
#
# Two earlier guesses about this are recorded because both were wrong. A first pass put
# it at 1.5x, having assumed every early finish was a Monarch death; most are
# eliminations, so it was out by about seven times. The second guess was that a run could
# never come out SHORTER, on the reasoning that eliminating a team only when everything it
# owns is dead is a strict superset of sudden death. That is true of the ending condition
# and false of the game: units that would have died with their Monarch keep fighting, so
# every later decision and RNG draw differs and the run that results is a different game
# -- four of them ended sooner. The claim to make is "more coverage on average", not
# "never shorter".
#
# Two runs below deliberately set it back to 0: the monarch-death win condition is sim
# logic in its own right (updateOutcome reading hadMonarch_), and a spectator whose game
# ended once wedged the referee, so "the game concludes" must stay covered.
