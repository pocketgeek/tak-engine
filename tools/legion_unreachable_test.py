"""legion_unreachable_test -- the AR-11 orders-complete probe on crowdbench's `unreachable` row.

  legion_unreachable_test.py CROWDBENCH [--units 200] [--ticks 10000] [--require-w2]

Runs `crowdbench --scenario unreachable` (every unit gets its own goal across a full-height
wall, so each walks to its nearest reachable spot, its approach point) in Legion and Retail
and prints, per unit class, when units reached that point and when their orders completed:

  approach_arrived          units Legion held at their approach point (member state 5)
  approach_arrive_tick_*    the tick they arrived (p50/p95/max over all movers; -1 = not all)
  orders_retired_tick_*     the tick their orders emptied
  approach_wait_max         worst (order completed - arrived) among units that did both

Invariants asserted always: the run is deterministic (a second run prints the same row),
every order completes within the horizon in both modes (an order never hangs for ever), and
Legion never completes an order before the unit arrived (approach_wait_max >= 0).

--require-w2 additionally asserts the W2 step 2 acceptance (PLAN section 0 row 11, 3.4 AR-11):
each order completes as soon as its unit reaches its spot, approach_wait_max <= 8 ticks. Off by
default: on the W2 head the wait is the whole kTrappedRetire (9000 from the order), and only
about half the units ever reach their point (the rest queue behind them), so it fails there.
