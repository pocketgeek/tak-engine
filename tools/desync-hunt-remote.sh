# desync-hunt-remote.sh -- the desync sweep with the REFEREE ON ANOTHER MACHINE,
# and with SEATED HUMAN PLAYERS so the referee actually compares hashes.
#
# WHY A SEATED PLAYER IS MANDATORY, NOT A VARIANT.
# Server::checkHashes opens with:
#       for (...) if (r.slots[i].type == 1 && r.slotClient[i] >= 0) ++live;
#       if (int(it->second.size()) < live || live == 0) return;
# `live` counts SEATED HUMAN slots only. A spectator watching 8 AIs leaves live == 0,
# so checkHashes returns on entry and NOTHING is ever compared -- and the spectator is
# sending a literal 0 anyway (gameview_net.cpp: `isSpectator() ? 0 : world_.stateHash()`),
# because its hash is documented as a pure progress ack. An all-spectator sweep is
# therefore incapable of reporting a desync, however long it runs. Every run below
# seats at least one human (--mphost WITHOUT TAK_MP_WATCH, TAK_MP_AIS=7).
#
# WHY REMOTE. On one box, client and referee are the same binary, so the only
# divergence reachable is client/server code asymmetry. Split across machines the
# sweep also exercises a real link: latency and jitter drive the adaptive jitter
# buffer (netDelay_ self-sizes to RTT), the kMaxLeadTicks=120 flow-control window and
# the 0.4s spectator heartbeat -- the same window that turned a client hang into a
# server-side wedge earlier in this work.
#
# The server binary is built STATIC and shipped: this host needs GLIBC_2.43 and the
# remote is Ubuntu 24.04 on 2.39, so a dynamically linked copy would not start. Static
# also keeps the referee on the SAME GCC as the client, which is what makes a hash
# mismatch unambiguous -- a real logic bug rather than a cross-toolchain artifact.
