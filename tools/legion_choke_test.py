"""legion_choke_test -- chokepoints as queues: route choice and admission (Legion 10,000 stage 8).

    legion_choke_test.py LEGION_SCENARIO SCALE_DIR [--data DIR]

Two scale files (tools/scenarios/scale/), workers exec, offset 0:

  * bridges-1000: two allied armies of 500 cross a river in opposite directions over bridges 4, 12 and 32 cells
    wide. Until stage 8 both took the nearest (12-cell) bridge and met head on on it: 5 of 1,000 arrived, 547
    stuck at the end. Openings (narrow crossings of sector boundaries) now carry their queues: routes are charged
    travel time plus queue delay (an opposing stream twice on a narrow passage), groups re-plan one at a time when
    the queues would move their choice, and a narrow passage admits one direction at a time. Checked: at least 450
    arrive, at most 80 stand stuck at the end, and both the 12-cell and the 32-cell bridge carry at least 40
    crossings each (scale.arrive.n, scale.stuck_end, gate.bridge1/2.crossings).
  * maze-1000: 850 bodies to a walled compound's central room through 6-cell doors. Until stage 8 every body queued
    at the west door (632 of 1,000 arrive in 20,000 ticks, 92 stuck); the queue's delay now sends groups round to
    the other doors. Checked: at least 850 arrive and at most 10 stand stuck at the end; an opening was charged
    (scale.choke.charged_fields > 0).

Exit 0 pass, 1 fail, 2 tooling, 77 skipped (no data).
